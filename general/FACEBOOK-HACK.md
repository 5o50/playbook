Facebook being used at a parasite for local searches

People rank un very high ticket niches
A major US city has a Facebook page ranking high for
"commercial real estate broker"

Simply create a Facebook page with:
your city name + keyword
"Tulsa Garge Door Repair"
or
"Tampa Commercial Real Estate Broker"

Make that keyword the title of the page and sprinkle
the phrase in everywhere you can with it still reading natural

Get 10 friends to interact with the page / leave you reviews

Run it through Omega Indexer to get it live

Build some tier 2 links at it.
You can honestly build PBNs or link frams at the page to get it
ranking becaue Facebooks domain authority is virtually indestructible.
