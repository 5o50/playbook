ITS NOT TIME TO SELL
Recognition of the need         60%
Information / Research          60%

WHEN THEY ARE EVALUATING IT'S NOT TIME TO SELL
Consideration                   30%

THATS WHERE THE CONVERSION FUNNEL BEGINS
AND THATS ANOTHER GAME
Last part is strongly based on emotions. (ZMOT Google)
Conversion                      10%

Everybody is fighting at the same spot
where there is conversions, sales.

And it's binary, buy or leave.
It's only 10% of the information funnel.
