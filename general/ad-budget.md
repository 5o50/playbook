On a small budget copy what works
you dont have the money to test

Reduce nb of variables
not lot of campains, adsets, ads
focus on few or one to gather more data
once its working scale it

focus on core offer AND niche down ! focus very specific niche
or best selling thing

and tailor message to that specific target

with low budget, trust Meta,
avantages+ audiences, follow their recommendations

no Brand Awareness, no Brand Lift on low budget

Do not change the settings everyday to optimize your campaign, meta needs conversions.
