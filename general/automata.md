# Automata
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory

Each model in automata theory plays important roles in several applied areas. 

- Finite automata are used in text processing, compilers, and hardware design.

- Context-free grammar (CFGs) are used in programming languages and artificial intelligence.
Originally, CFGs were used in the study of the human languages.

- Cellular automata are used in the field of biology, the most common example being John Conway's Game of Life. Some other examples which could be explained using automata theory in biology include mollusk and pine cones growth and pigmentation patterns.

Going further, a theory suggesting that the whole universe is computed by some sort of a discrete automaton, is advocated by some scientists.

The idea originated in the work of Konrad Zuse, and was popularized in America by Edward Fredkin.

Automata also appear in the theory of finite fields: the set of irreducible polynomials which can be written as composition of degree two polynomials is in fact a regular language.[2]
