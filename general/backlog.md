**Roll Forward**

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rollforward.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rollforward.asp)

technical analysis isn’t necessarily about the pattern itself, it’s about the psychology of what’s going on within the pattern.

As well, when bearish patterns fail, they can produce extremely quick and powerful bullish moves.

The best follow through out of an ascending or descending triangle does not take place towards the apex of the triangle, it takes place about 2/3 of the way from the left side to the apex. This is classical Edwards and McGee technical analysis 101. As the pattern progresses too far towards the apex, the psychology changes. It had become evident toward the end of the month that the bears just didn’t have enough firepower to push the market below that big support level, which also corresponded to the 50 day moving average.

**Spot a Whale**

[https://github.com/pmaji/crypto-whale-watching-app](https://github.com/pmaji/crypto-whale-watching-app)

Imagine that you are looking to understand if there is any whale activity at your local coffee shop (I know this is silly but I promise it is a good example; stay with me here). You could sit near the ordering area and write down each individual order. If someone comes along and orders 100 lattes, that would get your attention--you have spotted a whale! What if, however, someone was ordering 5 lattes, and then getting in the back of the line again, and ordering another 5 lattes, repeating this until they had purchased a total of 100 lattes? Both of these individuals had a whale-like impact on market movement, but if all you care about is the size of each individual order, you will miss out on the sneaky whales that may be splitting their orders across a ladder of price-points.

Given that GDAX's API doesn't display ETH addresses (only unique order IDs), we cannot say with 100% certainty that what looks like a "ladder price-point whale" is in fact a unitary actor. We have to make some assumptions. To continue the coffee shop metaphor, we aren't able to actually look at the people in line for coffee; instead, we have a blindfold on and are jotting down what we hear the barista say. We hear "1 order for 5 lattes" once and write it down, but if we hear "1 order for 5 lattes" 100 different times in close succession, then we can make the safe assumption that we are dealing with a whale, as this is analogous to seeing 100 orders for 10 ETH stacked in a ladder of pricepoints in close succesion on GDAX.
