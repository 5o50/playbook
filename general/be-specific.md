**BE SPECIFIC**

"What is meant by the word *red?*""It's a color.""What's a color?""Why, it's a quality things have.""What's a *quality?*""Say, what are you trying to do, anyway?"

You have pushed him into the clouds. If, on the other hand, we habitually go *down* the abstraction ladder to *lower* levels of abstraction when we are asked the meaning of a word, we are less likely to get lost in verbal mazes; we will tend to "have our feet on the ground" and know what we are talking about. This habit displays itself in an answer such as this:

"What is meant by the word *red?*""Well, the next time you see some cars stopped at an intersection, look at the traffic light facing them. Also, you might go to the fire department and see how their trucks are painted."

-- S. I. Hayakawa, *[Language in Thought and Action](http://books.google.com/books?id=0H1p2sMdyXEC&pg=PA88&lpg=PA88&dq=%22it%27s+a+quality+things+have%22&source=bl&ots=e-xeTes-ey&sig=CRIaG7PXpMZoC6hjqIf7ZqM1tzM&hl=en&ei=KM3ETc7QJZOWsAP56-mmCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22it%27s%20a%20quality%20things%20have%22&f=false)*

And now, no sooner does someone tell me that they want to "facilitate communications between managers and employees" than I say, "Can you give me a concrete example of how you would do that?" Hayakawa taught me to distinguish the concrete and the abstract; and from that small passage in Asprin, I picked up the dreadful personal habit of calling people's bluffs, often using the specific phrase, "Name three."
