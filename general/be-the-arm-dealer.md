In a Big Craze, Be the Arms Dealer
===

*Whenever there is a market fad/phenomena with low or no barriers and a flood of entrants—the best strategy is often: **Be the arms dealer.***

*The lowest profile players in high-profile, low-barrier industries are almost always the most profitable.*

*Don't sell wine, sell barrels.*

*Don't make movies, create animation software.*

*Don't own restaurants, build the restaurant supply company.*
