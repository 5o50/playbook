have no will, be effortless like water. dont think, feel. be soft and flexible

empty your mind

be formless

be shapeless

like water

you put water into a cup it becomes the cup

you out water into a bottle it become the bottle

you put water into a teapot it become the teapot

water can flow or it can crash

be water my friend
