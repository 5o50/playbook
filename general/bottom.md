One of the most difficult and intimidating tasks for any trader or investor is to try and determine when a particular stock has [bottomed](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bottom.asp), or reaches a point where it no longer decreases significantly. Everyone wants to buy low and sell high, but if you consider that a stock's price can be influenced by macroeconomic, political and economic events, stating with any certainty that a given stock has bottomed is a daunting task. Also, your stock is just one of the thousands of stocks that trade daily in markets worldwide. Knowing when a stock has bottomed can unlock huge profits and can also prevent big losses. So, how can one know with some confidence that a stock has reached a low point? No one can call stock bottoms with absolute certainty consistently, but there are some common fundamental and technical trends that appear in stocks that are about to hit bottom.

**1. Sector Characteristics**

The stocks you own in your portfolios belong to [sectors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sector.asp). Sectors are simply groups of public companies and stocks in a related industry. [Oil and gas](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/oil_gas.asp), technology, financial and retail are some sectors that may be familiar to investors. Typically, stocks follow in lock step to both the overall stock market and their respective sector. Identifying which sector(s) your stocks belong to is a good first step in determining if your stock is near bottom or a point of less intense declines.

Most of us are familiar with the [credit market meltdown](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp) in 2008, which decimated financial stocks and even drove financial icons out of business. Most financial stocks traded downward together for an extended period of time. Investors who looked to find "value" in certain financial stocks were crushed, as the entire [financial sector](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial_sector.asp) experienced a historical decline. The lesson learned is to identify and understand what sector your stock belongs to and compare its performance against the entire market.

**2. Price and Volume**

Once you identify your stock's sector, some other clues can give you some confidence your stock is nearing bottom. Many technicians think stock price and volume are the two most important indications of where a stock is going. Stocks tend to bottom when there are few [sellers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seller.asp) of that particular stock. It sounds ridiculously simple, but think about it: if few sellers exist, more buyers remain and buyers are more willing to pay a higher price for the stock; this means a price bottom has formed. (For related reading, see: [Use Market Volume Data to Determine a Bottom](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/090115/use-market-volume-data-determine-bottom.asp).)

Volume adds credibility to stock prices and price direction, to an extent. Remember, stocks trade on supply and demand, just like all other goods in a free market. There is just a lot more things that influence stock prices than say a gallon of milk. The higher the relative volume once the stock has finished going down, the more likely the stock will not see lower prices anytime soon. So, if stock XYZ's [average daily trading volume](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/averagedailytradingvolume.asp) was 5 million shares a day as it declined 50%, but during the last three trading days it has averaged over 15 million shares daily AND the price of the stock has appreciated, it is likely the stock has reached an [inflection point](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflectionpoint.asp) and is done going down significantly. Remember, fewer sellers exist at lower prices as most people were looking to "sell high." If only buyers remain, stock prices will rise.

**3. Keep Your Ear to the Street**

Perhaps an overlooked tell of when a stock is bottoming is its perception on The Street. Unfortunately, many average investors hear sound bytes on the business news and take it as gospel. Ironically, there is an entire school of investment in which the main strategy is to go against theconventional wisdom. These investors are aptly called [contrarians](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contrarian.asp). Contrarians tend to bet against what the "smart" money is doing. Many times going against the grain can be highly profitable and can also be helpful in determining if your stock has bottomed.

The oil and gas sector went through a significant [bear market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp) in sympathy with the great recession that began in 2007. Oil prices went down over 50% and stocks in the oil and gas groups were hemorrhaging. Business news hyped up the decline and [pundits](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pundit.asp) were talking about the demise of oil and the use of natural gas substitutes and solar energy. No one wanted to touch an oil stock with a 10-foot pole. Investors who went against the grain and snapped up [blue chip](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bluechip.asp) oil stocks saw a handsome profit. It pays to see all sides of a stock story.

Going against the grain is a strategy that many feel works well particularly at market tops and bottoms. As an investor, it is at least worth your time to listen to what everyone is saying and wonder: Can they all really be right?

**Conclusion**

Ideally, investors want to know when price trends are about to make a major change in either direction, whether they're reaching tops or bottoms. The bottom line is no one truly knows with certainty. Clues, such as a big volume spike on [price changes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-change.asp), and paying attention to your stock's sector, will give you some insight into whether your stock has reached a point where it will no longer decline significantly. Keep in mind these are just pieces in the puzzle of investing, but if you can add this skill set to your investment knowledge, you will likely be more successful investor.

**Spotting A Market BottomBy [Chris Seabury](https://www.investopedia.com/contributors/318/)**

Stock market [bottoms](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bottom.asp) can be challenging to spot. And many times, investors think that they have found this point, only for the major averages to head even lower. The big question many have is: just how do you know when a market bottom has taken place? This requires the tools and indicators that have identified major market bottoms in the past, and an understanding of what they are, how they work and that each indicator must correlate a similar reading.

**Stock Market Bottoms**Since the end of World War II, stock prices have generally bottomed six months into a [recession](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp). Once it becomes official that the country is in a recession, it is generally a rearview mirror indicator meaning that there have already been two or more quarters of negative [GDP](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp) growth. On the other hand, when we are emerging out of a recession, we will not know until many months later. This is one of the reasons that it can be so confusing for investors to spot major bottoms taking place.

**Things to Watch for**Just imagine how wonderful it would have been to buy stocks at bargain prices before major upward moves, such as January, 1975, August, 1982, or even March, 2003. All of those periods share some common patterns that should be observed in order to determine if the market is bottoming.

**The Double Bottom Pattern**The [double bottom](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doublebottom.asp) pattern is considered to be one of the most reliable of all the technical patterns. In this pattern, the major market averages will hit a low on heavy [volume](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp), then bounce back up and then retest the previous low on light volume.

The key is to watch and see how the averages trade when approaching that second low point. If the averages have a sizable break below the previous low, it is advisable to watch and see what happens. However, if the averages test that low point and then have some type of [reversal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reversal.asp), this could be a sign that a double bottom pattern is forming.

A second area to watch is volume. This is the total amount of buying and selling that is occurring. Generally, heavy volume on up or down moves shows strong conviction from either the buyers or sellers. When you see the volume lighten up on the downward moves and increase substantially on the upward moves, there is a large amount of buying taking place. After a major market bottom has occurred, you will see this heavy volume accompanied by a strong upward move in the major market averages.

**Economic Numbers**Generally, the stock market will bottom and start moving higher before you see it represented in economic numbers or headlines. In many cases, the more negative economic news headlines you see, the better. When the press represents the psychology of the moment, and we start to see consistent headlines showing how bad the economy is, it suggests that the sentiment of the crowd has become so negative that the vast majority have already moved out of their positions.

A second number to pay attention to is the [consumer confidence index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cci.asp). During and after market bottoms have occurred, you will see consumer spending and consumer confidence increase. When this happens, consumers are spending more money and corporate earnings are starting to rise. A third economic number to watch is purchasing managers' index, which measures the economic health of the manufacturing sector. When these two numbers have bottomed, then started to consistently rise for more than three months in a row, the manufacturing and service sectors are on the road to expansion once again. (For further reading, see [Economic Indicators For The Do-It-Yourself Investor](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/07/economic_indicators.asp).)

**High Yield Bonds**Another indicator to watch is the [high yield bond spread](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/high-yield-bond-spread.asp). High yield bonds are the bonds issued by companies who have a high possibility of default. To be able to attract investors to loan them money, they have to offer a higher interest rate. When lending standards are becoming easier, you will see the amount of interest or the spreads on these bonds drop. When this happens, it is a sign that investors and banks are becoming more willing to take risk. This would signal that economic conditions are starting to improve. (For more, see [Top 6 Uses For Bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/09/top-uses-bonds-investments.asp).)

**Copper Prices**Copper prices are a good indicator as to how strong or weak the global economy is. This metal is used in economic expansion in products such as pipes, radiators, air conditioners, electronics and computers, to name a few. Watching to see if the price of copper has bottomed or has room to fall further will help determine the overall worldwide demand for the metal. When demand has increased, you will start to see prices rise; when demand is falling, prices will follow.

Look for copper prices to finish declining and start to move in a similar upward pattern with the financial markets. This would be a real-time signal that manufacturers and home builders are seeing their businesses pick up. To keep up with the increases in demand, they have to use more copper, causing the price to rise.

**The Bottom Line**Market bottoms are accompanied by a variety of factors, such as high amounts of fear, a decrease in the volume on downward moves, a large increase in the volume on upward moves, double bottom patterns, improving economic numbers, the spread on high yield bonds narrowing and an increase in copper prices. However, it is important to remember that the financial markets look forward at least six months prior to any real improvement in the economic numbers. By using all of the indicators together, you have the key to spotting a market bottom.
