A NAME HAS TO TELL POTENTIONAL CUSTOMERS ABOUT THE BUSINESS YOU ARE IN.

Or you can take any name backed by a successful branding campaign, they will come to signify whatever the companies want them to mean.

The success of a name is much more a function of the implementation of the branding strategy

"the name doesn’t make much difference"

"What companies end up doing is a significant amount of advertising and creating an image around the name."

- a good name is a hook that sets itself into a person’s mind, linking their brain back to your idea
- the process of neatly packaging up that idea, discovering where it begins and ends so it can be linked as a discrete, easily remembered concept
- help the lowliest code library find an audience
- help formalize an informal process
- propel ideas about the world toward becoming talking points throughout it

I was going to start a company to do custom 3D printing with embedded custom electronics, but got derailed by a great job and bilateral carpometacarpal osteoarthritis, so I make it a gift to you:

CorgiStilts.

Yup. That’s the name. It is non-specific, but aren’t a lot of companies which make fine (even wonderful) electronics blessed with names which are catchy, have more than one meaning, and have little direct connection to what they make or do?

Apple

IBM

IKEA

Intel

Subway

There are lots more, and a lot of companies start with plebian names which either describe what they make too colloquially (Brad’s Drink, for instance) but change into something else (like CocaCola, which had a median name of CocaKola. Instead of the company being named because it manufactured a drink that Brad (nick name for the founder) had formulated, it became named for two of the contents: Coca leaves and Kola pods. Then, to make a catchy looking logo, the K was changed to C.)

IBM started life as CTRCo: Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, changed their name to International Business Machines, which didn’t actually sell machines at all: they leased their software (so they still had complete ownership rights) and installed and maintained the hardware (computer machines) for free, removing the hardware when the software licenses were not renewed and upgrading it when they wanted to. The change to the initials (as they’d used originally) turned them into IBM.

Apple started as Apple Computers, and Jobs gave various reasons over the years: that the Apple of Genesis contained “all the knowledge” (it actually was just the fruit of the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil, which still is pretty impressive). At the time, they were selling their single board Apple Computer for $666.00 (which may lend some support to this story). Later he said it was because he had been working on an Apple Farm.
