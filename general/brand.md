WRITE YOUR STORY ON THE BACK OF YOUR BUSINESS CARD
tells a story. The brands that tell stories make a dent in culture. You know who they are. You have a sense of them. If they came to dinner, you would have a sense of their personality.
What is currently capturing the collective imagination?

Some big companies do perfectly well but they donâ€™t touch me. My head might understand it but my heart is not interested. Even if a startup works in a B2B setting, itâ€™s important to build a brand that people care about, that has emotion, that has human centricity to it. When youâ€™re meaningful in culture, you become sustainable in business.

In a nutshell, branding is who you areâ€”and marketing is how you build awareness. Branding is your strategy, while marketing encompasses your tactical goals. In order to determine who your brand is, you need to ask yourself several questions. Questions that go beyond industry generalizations, and services or products offered and also questions to determine who you are as a company, and more importantly, who you are as a brand. The questions below are an excellent place to begin:\n\n    What are your core principles and values?\n    What is your mission statement?\n    What inspired you to build your business?\n    Why do you want to offer your products or services to your target audience?\n    What makes you unique?\n    What is your internal company culture?\n    What is your professional sense of style?\n    What are your communication characteristics?\n    What do you want to come to mind when someone hears your business name?\n    How do you want people to feel when they think of your business?\n    How do you want customers to describe you as a company?

Think digital, act analog. Thinking digital means that companies should use all the digital tools at its disposal â€“ computers, web sites, instruments, whatever â€“ to create great products. But companies should act analog â€“ that is, they must remember that the purpose of innovation is not cool products and cool technologies but happy people. Happy people is a decidedly analog goal.

â€œIf WeChat was a person, it would be your best friend based on the amount of time you spend on it. So, how could we put an advertisement on the face of your best friend? Every time you see them, you would have to watch an advertisement before you could talk to them.â€ Unlike many other Chinese apps, WeChat has no VIP subscription that provides an enhanced user experience, nor a full screen ad upon launching the app. Despite all the advertising revenue potential with an app that has over one billion daily active users, WeChat limits ads in its social feed to just two per day.
