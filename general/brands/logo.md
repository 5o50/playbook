symbol to signal to consumers a certain level of quality, experience, and trust.

**Logo**¬†is the central, identifiable visual element that helps customers discover, share and remember a company's brand. Usually it's in the form of an icon (mark or symbol), logotype, or combination of the two.

[](https://www.notion.so/d2a2175af83f444ead2cfce0f7580eb6#e54e9c3504714e28ba7c6c4be94b9a21)

The brands you use, wear, and display all tell little stories. They help you express your personality and beliefs, and they help others identify with you.

Logos are crafted to present the company name in an attractive, functional way. Symbols, on the other hand, are mini-billboards. Their job is to connect the tribe and convey meaning.

bottle so distinct that you would recognize if by feel in the dark or lying broken on the ground.‚Äù

**Symbols can be a status symbol like Apple, Versace‚Äôs Medusa, and Ferrari‚Äôs prancing horse.**

[](https://www.notion.so/d2a2175af83f444ead2cfce0f7580eb6#76b67633e09f4ff48f068c52bf3e6f15)

What areas of your brand can you distill and express through a simple visual shorthand?

**The key to developing your brand symbols is to focus on function.**

Coke challenged itself to create a bottle that was recognizable ‚Äúby feel in the dark or lying broken on the ground.‚Äù

The company‚Äôs focus on function led to an iconic design.

Douglas Atkins states in the¬†[Culting of Brands](http://amzn.to/1M5ukl8),

‚ÄúThere are also dangers in creating a symbolic system that is, well, symbolic of nothing. Aesthetics are not enough. Icons are only icons because they communicate a world of meaning to the community that honors them.‚Äù

Developing symbols for your brand are deliberate, and they take many forms. Symbols can be a navigational tool like the Twitter and Facebook icons. Symbols be a differentiator like the Coca-Cola bottle. Symbols can be a status symbol like Apple, Versace‚Äôs Medusa, and Ferrari‚Äôs prancing horse.

To create symbols for your brand start with a¬†key customer touch point. Coca-Cola, for example, focused on its bottle because it was the direct point of contact between the consumer and product. What is¬†the most visible or prominent customer touch point with your products and services? This a good starting point.¬†Challenge your team to develop a¬†visual shorthand that not only conveys meaning, but enhances the customer experience.

**The T-Shirt Test**

It‚Äôs often discussed that the epitome of branding is making your brand ‚Äútattoo worthy.‚Äù This is when you connect with your customers at such a deep, personal level they are willing to ink your brand on their skin.

I am not holding symbols up to the same standard. Instead make your symbols ‚Äút-shirt worthy.‚Äù

We live in a very branded society. You‚Äôre more likely to see a branded t-shirt than a blank one. Naomi Klein says, ‚ÄúLogos have grown so dominant that they have essentially transformed the clothing on which they appear into empty carriers for the brands they represent.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt consider this a bad thing. The logos we display on our clothing represent our values, beliefs, and connections. They signal which tribe you belong to.

Foursquare, the local search and discovery app, uses t-shirts to promote the brand. Users like¬†[Baratunde Thurston](http://baratunde.com/blog/2010/10/26/today-im-rockin-my-new-foursquare-t-shirt.html)¬†proudly wear ‚Äúmayor‚Äù t-shirts. To an outsider this might not mean much, but to people who use the app it‚Äôs a symbol.

In Foursquare you become mayor of a location, like a restaurant or coffee shop, by checking in more than anyone else. When you achieve the mayor status Foursquare rewards you with a crown badge. And depending on the location, these crown badges can be highly coveted.

The mayor t-shirts extends the digital realm of the Foursquare app to the real world. This helps the brand grow awareness, engage its users, and build loyalty.

Creating a symbol that works on a t-shirt is easier said than done. Most logos look terrible on a t-shirt. Walk around any trade show and ask yourself, ‚ÄúWould I wear these logo‚Äôd golf shirts in public?‚Äù

For a symbol to work on a t-shirt it has to adhere to three qualities:

1. **Simple:**¬†Simple images do better than complex ones. The Foursquare mayor symbol is identifiable¬†as an icon or a large graphic on a t-shirt. The simplicity of the image allows it to be widely recognizable.
2. **Connective:**¬†A symbol is more than a graphic. It has to be packed with meaning. Foursquare uses the mayor crown as a symbol, because that‚Äôs a badge people strive to acquire in the app. Use images that are packed with meaning and resonate with your tribe.
3. **Attractive:**¬†This may be obvious, but it can‚Äôt be overstated. Iconic symbols like the Apple logo or the Coca-Cola bottle have a powerful aesthetic quality. They are well balanced, well designed, and something people are proud to wear. Iconic symbols are beautiful.

If you can create a symbol that works on a t-shirt, that‚Äôs a pretty good sign it will work almost everywhere. And if you do create a symbol that is t-shirt worthy, then by all means print a bunch of t-shirts to give away. Get your customers to wear your brand.

**Symbols Build Brand Equity**

Every iconic brand has symbols, because it enhances the economic value of the respective corporation.

David Aaker writes in¬†[Managing Brand Equity](http://amzn.to/1hki30Q), ‚ÄúThe reality is that most firms and products are fairly similar; the differences that do exist, such as service quality, are difficult to communicate in an effective and credible manner. When products and services are difficult to differentiate, a symbol can be the central element of brand equity, the key to differentiating characteristics of the brand. The symbol can by itself create awareness, associations, and a liking or feelings which in turn can affect loyalty and perceived quality.‚Äù

The symbol isn‚Äôt an artistic expression of the brand. It‚Äôs an emotive communication device that‚Äôs been used since the dawn of mankind. And it‚Äôs one of your most effective devices to stand out in a highly competitive, information rich marketplace.

A great product with a strong value proposition may not be enough. Consumers don‚Äôt truly believe there¬†is a huge difference between products. That‚Äôs why we need to connect with them at a deeper level.

I‚Äôll ask it again. How are you going to visually convey your value proposition and beliefs in a short, concise way?

üí° **Advices**

**Pick a word from the dictionary**

If by the time you read through this list with a pen and pad in hand, you still don‚Äôt feel inspired, then you could do like Blizzard and Twitter did and just pick a random word from a dictionary.

**Remove or add an extra letter**

What if you have a really good name for your business, but can‚Äôt use it as it is? Why not do as Flickr and Tumblr do and drop the last vowel? You could also duplicate another letter or change a letter in your word in a way that still makes the word recognizable.

**Talk about what you believe in**

If you don‚Äôt like the story idea, you could use the name as a way to remind yourself ‚Äì and anyone who works with you ‚Äì about what you believe in and why you‚Äôre doing what you‚Äôre doing. Minolta, for example, means ‚Äúyour principle, what you believe in‚Äù.

**Tell your story**

Does your new business have a great story behind it? Why not tell it with your business name? Names such as Kenvelo (unable to decide on a name, the company was called Kenvelo, ‚Äúyesandno‚Äù in Hebrew), Virgin (the founders' way of saying they were completely new to business) and Mozilla (created as the Mozaic ‚Äì an internet browser-killer) were born the same way.

**Invent an alternative spelling**

Take a word that‚Äôs symbolic or essential for your company and invent a new spelling for it, like Reebok (alternate spelling of ‚Äúrhebok‚Äù, an African antelope).

**Make a grammar mistake on purpose**

This way of coming up with a new name could be a bit risky, so do consider the possibility of spending the next five or ten years listening to people correcting your brand name. Quora, for example, could be seen as a fake plural of the latin quorum (public assembly).

**Abbreviate**

Take a word that has a strong meaning for you or your business and extract a short art of it, just like Cisco (from San Francisco, where the company was founded) did.

**Look at your product from another angle**

Does your product remind you of something else? Look at it from different angles or ask your friends and family to tell you what your product looks like. Blackberry and Caterpillar are just two examples of names created using this technique.

**Use Latin**

If you had a Latin language class in school and ever thought that you‚Äôd never get to use this in real life, you were probably wrong. Latin is a great source for business names, take for example Acer (Latin for ‚Äúsharp‚Äù, ‚Äúable‚Äù) and Volvo (Latin for ‚ÄúI roll‚Äù), two of the most well-known and easy to remember names. You could also use a Latin word as a start for your new name and add another word to it, like Verizon (from the Latin ‚Äúveritas‚Äù, which means ‚Äútruth‚Äù and ‚Äúhorizon‚Äù).

**Make it descriptive**

If you think of your business, what is the one word, or pair of words that could describe what the business does best? Now write all your options on a piece of paper and visualize your new logo or a banner with your new name on it. An example of a brand using this technique is the supermarket chain 7-Eleven, where the name tells you straight away what‚Äôs special about this business: it‚Äôs open from seven in the morning to eleven at the night, every day.

**Use a symbol**

Another way to come up with a business name is to take a symbol or an essential element of your work and create a new name starting from that word. Pixar, for example, is a combination of the word pixel and the initials of one of its founders, Alvy Ray Smith.

**Use nicknames**

Using your kids‚Äô names or nicknames might sound a little strange, but just look at companies like Mercedes (named after the daughter of one of the founders) and Danone (named after the founder‚Äôs son‚Äôs childhood nickname); they don‚Äôt sound strange anymore, do they?

**Mix things up**

Another way of finding a new name for your business is trying various word combinations, such as your name and where you live. Some examples are DKNY (Donna Karan New York) and IKEA (from the founder‚Äôs name Ingvar Kamprad and where he grew up: Elmtaryd Agunnaryd).

**Take a look at a map**

Use a world map to get inspired, just like Adobe (after the Adobe Creek, running close to the founder‚Äôs house), Amazon (named after the largest river in the world, by volume of water) and Fuji (named after the highest mountain in Japan) did.

**Use your own name**

If you‚Äôre not convinced by any other names, why not use your own? Many of the most well-known brands were actually their inventor‚Äôs or their owner‚Äôs name, like Bayer (Friedrich Bayer was the founder of the company), Boeing (After William E. Boeing) and Grundig (named after the founder Max Grundig) and Cadillac (after the French explorer Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac).

**Use foreign words**

Even if your audience is based in one region, a foreign name (or foreign-sounding name) can be very memorable in your customers‚Äô native language. Just look at Audi (the Latin translation of the German name ‚ÄúHorch‚Äù), Altavista (Spanish for ‚Äúhigh view‚Äù) or Daewoo (‚Äúgreat house‚Äù in Korean).

**Get inspiration from mythology and literature**

Do you have a passion for literature or history? Look no further than your Greek and Roman legends! For example, ASUS (from the mythical winged horse Pegasus) and Nike (the goddess of Victory). A character, place or object could also be a good start for a name; like Samsonite (from the Bible character Samson) or Starbucks (from Starbuck, the young chief mate of the Pequod, in Moby Dick).

**Mash-ups**

Mix two or more words that are meaningful for you and your business. Some examples are Compaq (from ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù and ‚Äúpack‚Äù), Evernote (from ‚Äúforever‚Äù and ‚Äúnote‚Äù), Groupon (from ‚Äúgroup‚Äù and ‚Äúcoupon‚Äù) and Lego (from the Danish ‚Äúleg godt‚Äù, which means to ‚Äúplay well‚Äù).

**evoke familiarity and connection**

**Unique ‚Äî Yes, it has to be unique.**

There are tenable neurological reasons why your brand name should be unique. As long as it's not too wildly off-the-wall, a unique brand name can stick in people's minds like a burr on a hiking sock.

Yet the business reasons for a unique brand name are even more compelling. When a business enters the market place, it competes for a mindshare among the target audience. If it fails to catch their attention, it's doomed.

Furthermore, as brand signals increase in the digital marketing space, the brand's very existence depends on its unique identity.

You won't rise in ranking and be found by search engines if you choose a plain-vanilla word like "spark," or "hammer." You must differentiate yourself by creating an entirely new word or combination of words that doesn't break the cardinal rules of Simple, Short, and Memorable.

**Trendy(ish) ‚Äî Don't follow outdated suggestions**

A brand name must have a trendy vibe if it's going to connect with trendy people. And yet, you don't want to veer too far in that direction.

Why not? Because a brand name that's trendy today might be completely outdated tomorrow. You want to have a name that will endure the next five years.

Outmoded advice for brand name creation includes identifying available domain names and choosing your brand name based on that. This just isn't as important as it once was, particularly due to the advances of SEO and¬†[brand signals.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/neil-patel/how-to-analyze-your-brand_b_8230736.html)

You should still¬†[pick your domain name strategically](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/239872), but don't weaken your brand name based on domain name availability.

**Simple ‚Äî Make it easy to spell.**

Don't try to be cute by creating a brand name that is a misspelling of a common word. This will only confuse people and evoke bad memories of unpleasant spelling bees.

There is some wiggle room here. If your misspelling is so drastic that you essentially create a new word, that¬†might¬†be ok.

Hipmunk, for example, is a brand name that slaughters spelling, but violate expectation or conventional grammar. (See what I did there?)

**Short ‚Äî It needs to be easy to remember (part 2).**

One of the¬†[most-cited papers in psychology](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/)¬†has this casual title: "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two."

The researchers claim that the brain can't juggle a lot of information at one time. Although the brain's ultimate capacity is virtually unlimited, it still faces challenges in storing, processing, and retaining select bits of information simultaneously.

Don't burden the brain with too much information. A brief brand name boosts memorability, fluidity of speech, and catchiness.

Uber, IBM, Buffer, Apple--brevity is a beauty.

**Descriptive ‚Äî Make the name sell the brand's identity.**

Just as the brand name should have clarity, it should also be descriptive. The name should describe the business's industry, attitude, approach, and goals.

This doesn't mean that your brand name should list the product or service. Instead, it should capture the essence, the experience, and the benefits of the brand in an oblique or suggestive way.

Amazon, for example, chose a name that connotes massive growth and all-encompassing service. My brand,¬†[Quicksprout](http://quicksprout.com/), suggests rapid growth.

**Clarity ‚Äî Don't send mixed messages.**

The sound and feel of your brand name should suggest what the brand is all about.

For example, if your brand name is NomNom, this suggests food. NomNom should¬†not¬†be the name of a financial services SaaS. That would be confusing, and unencouraging.

To achieve¬†clarity,¬†assemble a list of the relevant buzzwords in your industry or niche. If you are creating a finance SaaS, you might have a list that includes "numbers," "spreadsheets," "accounting," or "books."

A hodgepodge of relevant words will trigger your brain to come up with a relevant name. Maybe this is how¬†[Freshbooks](http://www.freshbooks.com/)¬†came up with their name.

**Tap into the power of symbolism and sounds**

Certain sounds¬†[inspire positive emotions](http://brandroot.com/resources/item/49-the-power-of-sound-symbolism-in-your-business-name)¬†and result in experiences that are likely to be liked, remembered, and shared. Companies like Haagen Dasz and Limoncello have been leveraging this strategy for decades‚Äîto reinforce positive, memorable experiences through sound.

In a 2003, neuroscientist Vilanyanur Ramachandran¬†[published a study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilayanur_S._Ramachandran)¬†detailing the relationship between certain parts of the brain and metaphors. He concluded that sounds can be metaphors for images and that people experience sounds through colors and tastes.

When choosing your brand name, think about the words that you‚Äôre using in everyday life. At¬†[Brandroot](http://www.brandroot.com/)¬†you can pick out your new company name with ease. The founder, Michael Rader, points out you should focus on the words that you‚Äôre associating with specific sensory experiences: lightness, darkness, strength, weakness, sharpness, and dullness, as examples.

Think about the concepts that you learned in your high school English classes, including alliteration, assonance, interjections, and consonants. You can learn more and structure some of your ideas by¬†[reading this article here](http://brandroot.com/resources/item/49-the-power-of-sound-symbolism-in-your-business-name).

**Appealing ‚Äî The brand name should connect with your target audience.**

To say that a brand name should be "appealing" is pretty simple advice. Obviously, right?

Here's why I introduce it: a brand name should not merely be "appealing" overall (that's difficult to accomplish), but rather it should be appealing in particular to the brand's target audience.

Thus, to come up with the perfect brand name, you should first consider who it is you're trying to reach. What is their language? Their style? Their age? Their income? Their education? Their level of sophistication? Their interest? Their religious outlook? Their brand preference?

Take the brand VineMofo. This brand zeros in on the millennial, progressive, hipster population; they are not targeting baby boomer wine connoisseurs, not with a brand name like that.

I recommend¬†not¬†choosing a rudimentary, standard vocabulary word. Uber can be forgiven because it's not a common word. Apple can be forgiven, because they are, well, huge.

Make up your own word¬†a la¬†portmanteau.

Your brand name is a product itself. You have to¬†sell¬†it. It communicates the value, the purpose, and the identity of your business. When you can successfully connect the dots between your audience and your brand name, then you will achieve true appeal.

**Memorable ‚Äî It needs to be easy to remember.**

The human brain is notoriously¬†[bad at remembering names](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/08/why-do-we-forget-names-as-soon-as-we-meet-people/375815/). Why? The brain stores names in its short-term or working memory. In ordinary life, our working memory can be likened to our desktop. It keeps the information we are working on active and present for a time, but have too many windows open, and the system starts to crash.

The downside of working memory is that we can't keep track of everything at once, so, we forget things.

To be memorable, a brand name should counteract the brain's easy-in-easy-out tendency. How do you do this? By anchoring the brand name to another feeling, attitude, or sensation.

There are different types of memory. If your brand name can stimulate two types of memory--say, a physical¬†[sensation](http://theweek.com/articles/460769/12-things-know-about-how-brain-works)¬†and an emotional memory-- then the brain is more likely to remember it.

Here are some suggestions for creating a memorable brand name:

- Make it short (discussed below).
- Make it unique (discussed below).
- Use familiar words or sounds.

**Alliteration**

Alliteration is the repetition of the same sound at the beginning of two or more words in a sentence or phrase. This only needs to be a sound, not the same letter. Some examples are Best Buy, Krispy Kreme, Range Rover, Dunkin‚Äô Donuts and Coca-Cola. Alliterations give your name a ‚Äúbeat‚Äù that can be catchy and memorable.

**Alliteration**

**Assonance**

Assonance happens when vowel sounds are repeated in words or phrases. Assonance can occur in a¬†single word or a string of words (e.g. YouTube, H√§agen-Dazs and FedEx), and it creates a pleasing sound.

**Consonance**

the recurrence of similar-sounding consonants in close proximity, especially in prosody.

**Imagery**

There has been¬†[research](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/words-can-change-your-brain/201208/the-most-dangerous-word-in-the-world)¬†published regarding how our brains connect words with emotions. This shows that people can experience sounds in the same way they experience color or taste. Some of the most cherished phrases in literature are those that evoke images in the reader's mind.

**Enduring ‚Äî More than just your own name**

It would be nice if your brand were to outlive you. A brand can have a revolutionary effect on a generation. When that brand is inextricably tied to a single individual, it is less likely to do so.

With all due respect to Walt Disney, I suggest choosing a name that can endure alongside you, apart from you, and long after you are gone.

**Evocative**

**Remarkable**

**Contextual**

**Use memorization techniques to find concepts that stick**

The best company names are emotion-driven and memorable as a result. If you‚Äôre struggling to name your company, stop laser focus on what you want your company to be. Instead, think about the emotions that you want your target customer to feel.

Start by creating a mindmap of the concepts related to your¬†[business](https://thenextweb.com/vocabulary/business/). Explore descriptive words, emotions, and experiences that you‚Äôve felt in building your business or brand. From there, make an outline of the visual images associated with your company.

Consider going through the same mental exercises from when you were a child in school‚Äîplaying memorization games through mnemonic devices to stretch your imagination further. This approach will help your mind venture into territory that you hadn‚Äôt yet considered. By exercising you mind, you‚Äôll encounter new concepts and linguistic connections to build upon.

[As Rader points out](http://brandroot.com/resources/item/31-the-memory-game-using-memorization-techniques-to-choose-the-right-business-name), your goal in choosing a name for your business should be to find a concept that resonates with as many people as possible, rather than a select few customers. Create a visual image that your target audiences can easily recall. No matter what you decide or what relationships you find, always make sure to face-test your ideas.

**Become a lexical innovator**

If you can‚Äôt find a word that perfectly captures the essence of your brand, invent your own. Words are ever-changing and follow evolutionary cycles. There are new words, slang or formal, entering the market, all the time.

A readily apparent example of this trend is google‚Äîa word that arose from complete obscurity to eventually earn its place in the Oxford Dictionary. This was a company that walked away from what was common and known to test a completely new concept.

[Rader encourages](http://brandroot.com/resources/item/73-hip-trendy-business-names-are-you-bae-or-rekt)¬†founders, brand managers, and other professionals responsible for naming to venture outside of their comfort zones. Explore slang that communities are using, and ask new audiences to describe your brand from a casual, authentic perspectives.

Innovation and progress come from venturing into new terrain. Your business name should be no different from your product or service‚Äîask people to give words to your brand with a fresh pair of eyes.

If you need a word, invent it.

**Unique and Unforgettable**

In the trade, this is called "stickiness." But the issue of stickiness turns out to be kind of, well, sticky. Every company wants a name that stands out from the crowd, a catchy handle that will remain fresh and memorable over time. That's a challenge because naming trends change, often year by year, making timeless names hard to find (remember the dot.coms).

**Avoid Unusual Spellings**

When creating a name, stay with words that can easily be spelled by customers. Some startup founders try unusual word spellings to make their business stand out, but this can be trouble when customers "Google'" your business to find you, or try to refer you to others. Stay with traditional word spelling, and avoid those catchy words that you love to explain at cocktail parties.

**Easy to Pronounce and Remember**

Forget made-up words and nonsense phrases. Make your business name one that customers can pronounce and remember easily. Skip the acronyms, which mean nothing to most people. When choosing an identity for a company or a product, simple and straightforward are back in style, and cost less to brand.

Occasionally, business owners will choose names that are nonsense words. Quirky words (Yahoo, Google, Fogdog) or trademark-proof names concocted from scratch (Novartis, Aventis, Lycos) are a big risk. Always check the international implications. More than one company has been embarrassed by a new name that had negative and even obscene connotations in another language.

**Give a Clue**

Try to adopt a business name that provides some information about what your business does. Calling your landscaping business "Lawn and Order" is appropriate, but the same name would not do well for a handyman business. Your business name should match your business in order to remind customers what services you provide.

**Keep it simple**

The shorter in length, the better. Limit it to two syllables. Avoid using hyphens and other special characters. Since certain algorithms and directory listings work alphabetically, pick a name closer to A than Z. These days, it even helps if the name can easily be turned into a verb, like Google me.
