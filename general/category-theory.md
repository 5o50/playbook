[Category Theory for Programmers: The Preface](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/)

> In object-oriented programming, an idealized object is only visible through its abstract interface (pure surface, no volume), with methods playing the role of arrows. The moment you have to dig into the implementation of the object in order to understand how to compose it with other objects, youâ€™ve lost the advantages of your programming paradigm.

> Category theory is about composing arrows. But not any two arrows can be composed. The target object of one arrow must be the same as the source source object of the next arrow. In programming we pass the results on one function to another. The program will not work if the target function is not able to correctly interpret the data produced by the source function

> Once you realize that types are sets
