Start from the end.

Don't critizise, condem, complain.
It's futile, it puts a person on the defensive.
It's dangerous, it wounds a person pride, hurts his sense of importance, arouse resentment.

Give honest appreciation
we all desire to be important 
talk about what they want
show them how to get it

The right thing at the right moment
Be human, be real, be authentic
Add value to their lives, dont ask for value

Inspire with action every day, christlikeness.

Humans are not creatures of logic, they are creatures of emotion.
Bristling with prejudice, motivated by pride & vanity.


We are all flawed and imperfect.
Particularly the less fortunate, the mistaken, the afraid.
Be civilized and respectful.

Talk about what it feels like
No facts - no attacks on anyone

Don't tell what to think.

If you cannot relate to other people pain, you are not in the right team.

If you cannot be kind, if you won't emphathize, team humanity, we are all in this together.

RELATABLE
Does that look familiar to the viewer ?

RELEVANT
Is it a topic everyone talks about RIGHT NOW ?
use trends and momentum (timely) (actionable tips) ()

SHAREABLE
Is it something people want to talk about with their friends ?
=> shock factor in content & form (taboo)

Don't explain, argue.

Divide & Conquer

Writing is not about communicating your ideas, it's about changing readers ideas.

Education is the best marketing.

What is valuable is not in the content or in the world. What is valuable is in the readers minds.
Start from what is in the readers minds.

Persuation depends on what they doubt, why they are wrong.

Know your community.

No desperate moves.

Concentre toi sur la lumière, pas l'obscurité.
Be your own light.

Do not penetrate the essence of things.
The meaning of which we do not know anyway.
Develop concepts which allow us to talk in a productive way about phenomena in nature.

produire des idÃ©es, c'est bien mais pas suffisant : il faut Ãªtre crÃ©atif tout au long du processus crÃ©atif, y compris en phase d'Ã©valuation au cours de laquelle il faut faire preuve d'imagination dans la transformation et l'interprÃ©tation des idÃ©es proposÃ©es.

The closer you are to the pain, the more you can empathise with others.

The scene is a conversation.
The content is a conversation, the characters keep the reader focused.
