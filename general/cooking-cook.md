**Calories**

Setting calorie deficit or surplus correctly. No supplement. No cardio. Only good nutrition.

Between 13 to 16 Kcal per pounds

Maintenance Calories : **2188 KCal/day** (168 lbs (76kg) * 13)

25% calorie deficit : **1638 KCal/day for fat loss** (2288 * 0.75)

With a 25% energy deficit most people will lose about 1-1.5 lbs (500-700g) of fat per week.

Overweight people will usually lose more than that, about 1.5-2 lbs (700g-1kg) per week.

Very lean guys (9% body fat or less) should use a slightly lower deficit (15-20%) or cycle calories.

Because they have less fat overall, the risk of muscle and/or strength loss is increased when using a larger deficit.

You may need to adjust these numbers as youâ€™re losing body fat and weight. If you no longer lose weight at the rate of 1-1.5 lbs per week, lower your calorie intake by 8-10%. If you find youâ€™re losing weight too fast, increase your calories by 5-10%.

**Macro-nutrients**

To prevent muscule loss or sustain muscle gain, maintain healthy hormonal status and good gym perf

No processed food. Eat real food !

lean meats, vegetables, fruits and root vegetables allow us to eat a large quantity of food for little calories.
