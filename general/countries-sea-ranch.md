**What is the least impact I need to make on the land?**

bay area iconoclast

Confronted by on-the-ground evidence of houses that neither honored nor reflected the original concept, the Association Board, the Design Committee and Association members committed to reversing the trend of creeping suburbanism. The Board of Directors commissioned the Vision Interpretive Program Committee to undertake an educational program to discuss the concept and the responsibility of members to uphold it. This guide is one part of that effort.

Principles At Lawrence Halprin’s “Taking Part” Workshops in 1983, 1993, and 2003, Sea Ranchers spelled out principles that supported the concept.

None were legally mandated, but all were agreed on by common consent. Some of the principles listed:

• Nature predominates not buildings

• Rural setting not suburban

• Home size modest not enormous

• Exteriors simple not showy

• Design guidelines not “anything goes”

• Sense of community not “statement” houses

• Aesthetics valued not disregarded
