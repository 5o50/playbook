# CPC Scale

The Cost Per Click (CPC) scale typically ranges from $0 to $5 and above, depending on various factors such as industry, competition, and ad quality. Here's a general CPC scale:

Low CPC | $0 - $0.50: high efficiency
Moderate CPC | $0.50 - $1.00: acceptable range
High CPC | $1.00 - $2.00: may need optimization
Very High CPC | $2.00 - $5.00: requires immediate attention
Extreme CPC | $5.00+: very low efficiency

It's important to note that a good CPC can vary by industry. For example:

- E-commerce: $0.50 to $1.50
- Finance and Insurance: $2.00 to $5.00
- Technology: $1.00 to $3.00
- Travel and Hospitality: $0.70 to $1.50
- Retail: $0.50 to $2.00[1]

A recent study found that the average CPC for Google Ads across industries is $2.69 for search ads and $0.63 for display ads[3]. However, factors such as keyword competition, ad rank, and brand vs. non-brand keywords can significantly influence CPC rates[3].
