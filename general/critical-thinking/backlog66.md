QUESTION YOUR TOUGHTS CRITICALLY

THOUGHTS ALWAYS OPERATE ON THE KNOWLEDGE — ON THE PAST

KRISHNAMURTI: I really don’t know. I only know this, and I really don’t know whether thought can function in any field at all, except this. I really don’t know. When I say, “I don’t know”, which doesn’t mean I am expecting to know, when I say I really don’t know—what happens? I climb down the ladder. I become, the mind becomes, completely humble. Now that state of “not knowing” is intelligence. Then it can operate in the field of the known and be free to work somewhere else if it wants to.

ne tourne pas autour du pot

mind readiness is wisdom

Thought is the response of memory.

Understanding is nothing to do with thought. You may reason, which is the process of thinking, logic, till you say, “I don’t understand it”; then you become silent, and you say, “Ah! I see it, I understand it.” That understanding is not a result of thought.

overthinking leads to depression, for problems that doesnt exist

Our culture has accepted two huge lies. The first is that if you disagree with someone's lifestyle, you must fear or hate them. The second is that to love someone means you agree with everything they believe or do.

Both are nonsense. You don't have to compromise convictions to be compassionate.

You don't have to be the best, to succeed all you need is to be the right.

c’est souvent le manque d’informations (la version d’une partie) qui cause vos problèmes.
