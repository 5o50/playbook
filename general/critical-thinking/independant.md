to make something simple for other people you must first make good sense of it for yourself and perceive differences in point of view.

The irony is that we’re choosing not to invest in developing the hearts and minds of leaders at the exact same time as we’re scrambling to figure out what we have to offer that machines and AI can’t do better and faster.
