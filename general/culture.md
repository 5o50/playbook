Culture
===

_An organization and culture will often share beliefs and ways of understanding the world. This helps smooth communications and agreement, but can also become fatal blinkers that blind everyone to impending dangers._

The major elements of culture are symbols, language, norms, values, and artifacts.


- The way people live and what they believe
- plays the role of guide, guides our behaviour laying down norms and values
- **the world happening outside the company's walls**
- The picture is **more likely to be one that represents contradictory and confusing cultures battling for the soul of the organization as well as those of its employees**.
- **Culture is not about a clear, sharp image of corporate and individual identity but deals in the ambiguity of everyday existence in a world of complexand often only partially shared meaning.**
- individuals also were at least to some extent the creators of culture
