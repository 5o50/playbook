**how it works ?**

- But meanings change because culture changes. It surrounds us at all times.
- Culture is learned. It is shared. It takes time to develop, is transmitted across generations, and is subject to change.
- Cultural differences contribute to the diversity in people's thinking and living styles.
- culture operates as if it were independent of individuals
- It is important to know the past that has shaped your present and is going to influence your future.
- **educate people.** CULTURE IS NOT INNATE. It is LEARNED ! To take pride in the culture you belong to and to respect its teachings, you must first know it.

**It takes years to from**

It is true that culture influences us, but it is also true that we influence culture. In fact, culture evolves over time and takes years to develop. It is not a set of rules made by one or more people and followed by generations. With passing time, a culture develops and even changes in the process.
