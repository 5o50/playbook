> Art is about trying to find the good in people and making the world a more compassionate place.

la compassion infinie is what gives you power for yourself â€” take care with no effort but love

COMPASSION IS THE KEY

GIVE ALL YOU CAN TO OTHERS BUT DONT LOOSE YOURSELF

or you will not be able to give good

dont allow your wounds to become what you are not
