2. Zoning: grouping rooms by their function.
There is four types of zones:
a. Social zones: living room, dining room and foyer
b. Work zones: office, garage, kitchen and gym
c. Private zones: bedrooms, bathrooms
d. Storage zones: kitchen clost, bathroom clost, bedroom closet

Private zones are usually located in one area and away from the noise of social zones.
Work zones are supposed to be made more accessible.

The space planning process recognizes which areas and functions are to be inter-related; that is to say, in a well-designed space, activities should flow smoothly and effectively from one zone area into another.
