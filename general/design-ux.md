START FROM CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND WORK BACKWARD THE STRATEGY
Focus on the user story -- intentions instead of the UI
List exactly what the user will do to achieve his or her goals and how the system will respond to each user interaction
User has a relationship with his device experience

**Make them smiles or laugh or angry in any way !**

delight the user

1st priority is always SPEED

'- **Make the user feel at the cutting edge (Fashionable new (Deleuzian) Paradigm)**

COMFORTABLE
MAYA  METHOD: what is cool is MAYA -- make it familiar and surprising

WHAT IS THE DESIGN BRIEF ? 
ex: "How do I take a train from London to New York ?"

when I see someone struggling with the product; he is not stupid; there is something to improve

Security at the expense of usability comes at the expense of security. if your â€œsecure systemâ€ isnâ€™t easy to use, people wonâ€™t use it, negating the security benefit.

> **Remove distractions to focus attention where it needs to be.**

describes one way to use the system, is centered around a goal (user profit)
+ written from the perspective of a user
+ uses the natural language of the business, and - on its own - does not tell the whole story.
+ User Stories contain, with user role, goal and acceptance criteria.
+ Use Cases contain equivalent elements: an actor, flow of events and post conditions respectively (a detailed Use Case template may contain many more other elements).
+ Define functions and think of features that support the functions

- holistically Consistent UNIFIED UX offers more functionality...all in a single, integrated app â€” as many features as possible into one application
                - FAST but not faster (respect user pace)
                - SIMPLE but not simpler (basic/dumb)
                - EFFICIENCY â€” reduce the screen time â€” we value user disengagement â€” not engagement
                - focus on small number of optimized valuable activities, strongly support things you value
                - digital minimalism â€”diminishing the large things, miss out on everything else.
                - assist the user intent; gets out of the way almost disappear; go with the way
                - minimal interface â€” rich social interactions.
                - **physical world first** - mobile-first - offline first: processing payments offline via QR codes at brick-and-mortar stores, live events, vending machines, restaurants, and hotels. The network effects are obvious and substantial: The more places that accept these payments, the more users will jump on board (and it goes both ways, both offline and online) â€¦ benefitting everyone all round.
                - **Natural design** â€” respect the human & environement â€” INTUITION, BALANCE & HARMONY
                - **Customizable**  â€” there is no avg user â€” every user is different.
                - **Clutter-free â€”** deceptively simple: let the user actively search for and discover all of these 3rd-party services themselves.
                - **Trusted** â€” **full ownership** â€” technology that you fully own. no spyware. no ads. no microphone. encryption â€” trusted by its usersâ€” is our foremost concern â€” so we can serve more sensible features like "Pay" or "Identity"
                - As media analyst Marshall McLuhan famously wrote, "**The medium is the message.**" In other words, "the form of a medium embeds itself in any message it would transmit or convey, creating a symbiotic relationship by which the medium influences how the message is perceived.
            - USER MUST FEEL
                - assistance, not dependence
                - valuable activities
                - being taken care of â€” educated
                - FLUID (ANIMATIONS ARE KEY.) streamlined interaction- liquid workflow
                - NO BIAS (woman/men/culture) design for kids unisex - simple white
                - evidence about the UI â€” able to adopt it quick â€” learn at his own pace â€” new things to discover
                - order / balance / harmony: bring order to the user mind â€” to sooth his anxiety
                - PLEASURE
                - PLAYFUL / FUN (GAME â€” WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW. MAKE A MINIMAL UI GAME â€” "TAP THE RECTANGLE" )
                - AT HOME
                - COMFORTABLE
                - IN CONTROL â€” if you can control, at least give the sense of control
                - TRUST - SECURITY
                - POWERFUL
                - VIVID
                - understatment has a chic denied to over emphasis
                - internal locus of control
            - **The right technology is a tool:**
                You can buy this device like you can buy a hammer. It's just a tool, isn't it what is all about technology ? A tool to help you.
                - a tool hides nothing
                - a tool adds nothing more than its function
                - a tool care only about the users and its environment.
                - a tool is accessible to any human being, no matter his age, color, religion


- **Product Design Strategy**
            as intuitive and straightforward as possible,
            We take on a habit of **understanding the essence (the question we answer) of each function and service** by **direct observation of user experimentation and cutting everything that goes against user interests.**
            > intuitive, carefully crafted, or just plain fun. We are busy focusing on small details.
            > Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it [a product] looks like. Itâ€™s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.

DESIGN IS HUMAN CENTERED
        (needs, useful, usable, enjoyable, what makes life easier )
        ITS MORE THAN SIMPLE ERGONOMICS (putting button in the right place)
        â€”> Understanding CULTURE and CONTEXT before starting having ideas

Good Designers understand how to use a material to its fullest extent.
