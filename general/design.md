The height of cultivation is simplicity.

Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.

L'hiver arrive !
On a besoin de chaleur et de couleurs.

Simplicity is not the absence of clutter, that's a consequence of simplicity
Simplicity is somehow essentially describing the purpose and place of an object and product.
The absence of clutter is juste a clutter free product. That's not simple.


The highest level of mastery is simplicity.

Law of contrast  (Josef Albers)
Context informs perception.

Background color affect how colored objects are perceived.

**ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS FIRST**
Focusing on the needs of humans
Getting the process out of the hands of designers
Getting the active participation of the community
We can tackle bigger and more interesting questions

make the product iconic. add meaning â€” story to the product â€” devil is in the details.

Tell a great interactive story
Friendly, invinting  and functional


- As far as the customer is concerned, **the interface is the product.**
        The way that you accomplish tasks with a product â€” what you do and how it responds â€” that's the interface


Functionality can be improved by testing a variety of different sizes and placements of UI elements to allow users quicker and easier access. Designs with otherwise high functionality will likely be considered useless if people are unable to navigate and find what they are looking for. Consider the learning curve required to use the application and devise a way for each screen to provide a simple experience for beginners and â€˜power usersâ€™ alike.. Successful designers focus on functionality before form, and later bring both into balance.

DESIGN THE PRIMITIVES WELL AND COMPOSE WITH THAT !
