> “Beauty does not come from decorative effects but from structural coherence.”

> "Beauty is the balance between two extremes"

> Order is clarity, order is power, order is consistent, order is beauty

> Keep close to the essence. The ONE ESSENCE.

> IF ITS NOT PERFECT, REMOVE SMTHG

> **get your boundaries and standard straight**

> when it comes to standards, as a leader, it’s not what you preach, it’s what you tolerate.

> DO NOT ACCUMULATE. BUT ELIMINATE. NOT DAILY INCREASE. BUT DAILY DECREASE.

> TO REACH THE ESSENCE OF THINGS, **ALL** non-essential elements must be eliminated.

> PERFECTION IS WHEN THERE IS NOTHING ELSE TO REMOVE

> **LET GO OF YOUR PAST WORK AND START FROM BLANK PAGE. YOU ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER. YOU BECAME.**

> ORDER —> WITH GREAT POWERS COMES GREAT RESPONSABILITIES.

“The important thing is this: to be able, at any moment, to sacrifice what we are for what we could become.”

if you try to remember you will loose — empty your min — you have it — like water

**keep your essence pure - outside is reflection of inside (form follows function)**

**Sophistication** : wisdom, subtlety, and good taste rather than crudeness, stupidity and vulgarity

Write for yourself, don’t care about the reader. Please yourself
