**Principle of Optimality (dynamic programming)**

**Optimal Substructure**

A problem has optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed efficiently from optimal solutions of its sub-problems.

In other words: **We can solve larger problems given the solutions to its smaller sub problems.**
