- FOLED SHEET OF PAPER WITH 3 GOALS OF DAY

Performance is the art of avoiding work, making any work you do efficient as possbiel.
It works with, not against it.

75% preparation, 25% execution.

When struggling to start work on a smaller part.
When struggling to finish ship a smaller whole.

Sometimes an ok answer is better than a good anszer late.
