Panel des emotions

## “Emotions are like waves. Watch them disappear in the distance on the vast calm ocean.”

## Relax, let go. But remember only one thing. YOU ARE A WITNESS.

Giving my feeling a name didnâ€™t make it less scary, yet it made it more approachable. And while I still feel sales anxiety, as it would take a long time to  rewire the inner workings of my mind, I can now soothe myself by  pointing to it, and distancing myself from it - hey, itâ€™s just the sales  anxiety, itâ€™s OK, now go talk to that customer.

Quelles sont toutes les emotions existantes ?
Understand the spectre of human emotions. Play in every single occasion.

Comment les vivres ? Les interpreter par l’experience personelle, les retransmettre

Let it flows 

your are a witness

> dont let bad energy come to your temple / if you let them inside you will get agitated — its their problems its not yours

Don't let negative energy come in, make them go away with love and caring.

If you feel agitated, they are IN, BREATH  and ALIGN you body and energy again

CONTROL YOUR EMOTIONS OR THEY WILL CONTROL YOU

L’autorégulation émotionnelle est fortement en lien avec la motivation à apprendre (cf. article de Brewer dans ce numéro) et le développement du sentiment d’être capable d’apprendre et de maitriser une langue grâce à l’environnement de la classe (Puozzo Capron, 2012).

"Into a soul absolutely free from thoughts and emotion, even the tiger finds no room to insert its fierce claws." In Chi Sao, the mind is devoid of all fear, inferiority complex, and is free from all attachment, and it is master of itself. It follows its own course like water; it is like the wind that blows where it lists.

When my acute self-consciousness grew to what the psychologists refer to as the “double-bind” type, my instructor would again approach me and say, “preserve yourself by following the natural bends of things and don’t interfere. Remember **never to assert yourself against nature**; **never be in frontal opposition to any problems**, **but control it by swinging with it**. Don’t practice this week: Go home and think about it.”

After spending many hours meditating and practicing, I gave up and went sailing alone in a junk. On the sea I thought of all my past training and got mad at myself and punched the water! Right then — at that moment — a thought suddenly struck me; was not this water the very essence of gung fu? Hadn’t this water just now illustrated to me the principle of gung fu? I struck it but it did not suffer hurt. Again I struck it with all of my might — yet it was not wounded! I then tried to grasp a handful of it but this proved impossible. This water, the softest substance in the world, which could be contained in the smallest jar, only seemed weak. In reality, it could penetrate the hardest substance in the world. That was it! I wanted to be like the nature of water.

Suddenly a bird flew by and cast its reflection on the water. Right then I was absorbing myself with the lesson of the water, another mystic sense of hidden meaning revealed itself to me; **should not the thoughts and emotions I had when in front of an opponent pass like the reflection of the birds flying over the water?** This was exactly what Professor Yip meant by **being detached** — **not being without emotion or feeling, but being one in whom feeling was not sticky or blocked**. Therefore in order **to control myself I must first accept myself by going with and not against my nature.**

“You must be shapeless, formless, like water. When you pour water in a cup, it becomes the cup. When you pour water in a bottle, it becomes the bottle. When you pour water in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Water can drip and it can crash. Become like water my friend.”

**WATER MAKE THE WORLD EVOLVE CUZ IT CONQUER ALL THE FLAWS. AND PURIFY THE DIRTY. AND TAKE THE WAY OF LEAST RESISTANCE. WATER IS THE WAY. BE LIKE WATER**

> control — la paix est a ma portée

EMOTIONS ARE REACTIONS (protection del ego)

Cortex

“When the brain builds a model of the world, everything has a location relative to everything else,” Mr. Hawkins said. “That is how it understands everything.”

“The cortex knows the location of everything,” Mr. Hawkins said. Mr. Ahmad had no idea what he was talking about.

As Mr. Hawkins looked at that cup, he decided that cortical columns did
not just capture sensations. They captured the location of those
sensations. They captured the world in three dimensions rather than two. Everything was seen in relation to what was around it.

Cognitive processing is subject to global modulatory parameters, which adjust the cognitive resources of the system to the environmental and internal situation. These modulators control behavioral tendencies (action readiness via general activation or arousal), stability of active behaviors/chosen goals (selection threshold), the rate of orientation behavior (sampling rate or securing threshold) and the width and depth of activation spreading in perceptual processing, memory retrieval and planning (activation and resolution level). The effect and the range of modulator values are subject to individual variance.

Emotion is not understood as an independent sub-system, a module or a parameter set, but an intrinsic aspect of cognition. Emotion is an emergent property of the modulation of perception, behavior and cognitive processing, and it can therefore not be understood outside the context of cognition. To model emotion, we need a cognitive system that can be modulated to adapt its use of processing resources and behavior tendencies.

In the Psi-theory, emotions are interpreted as a configurational setting of the cognitive modulators along with the pleasure/distress dimension and the assessment of the cognitive urges. The phenomenological qualities of emotion are due to the effect of modulatory settings on perception and cognitive functioning (i.e. the perception yields different representations of memory, self and environment depending on the modulation), and to the experience of accompanying physical sensations that result from the effects of the particular modulator settings on the physiology of the system (for instance, by changing the muscular tension, the digestive functions, blood pressure and so on). The experience of emotion as such (i.e. as having an emotion) requires reflective capabilities. Undergoing a modulation is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition of experiencing it as an emotion.


Look beyond anger.

success has nothing to do with your feelings.
