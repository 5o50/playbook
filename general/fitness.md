**Eat the same food everyday**

**Two meals a day (Intermittent Fasting)**

**14h** - First meal of the day 40% of calories

90g protein, 30g fat, 80g carbs

**Calories**

Setting calorie deficit or surplus correctly. No supplement. No cardio. Only good nutrition.

Between 13 to 16 Kcal per pounds

Maintenance Calories : **2002 KCal/day** (154 lbs (70kg) * 13)

25% calorie deficit : **1501.5 KCal/day for fat loss** (2002 * 0.75)

With a 25% energy deficit most people will lose about 1-1.5 lbs (500-700g) of fat per week.

Overweight people will usually lose more than that, about 1.5-2 lbs (700g-1kg) per week.

Very lean guys (9% body fat or less) should use a slightly lower deficit (15-20%) or cycle calories.

Because they have less fat overall, the risk of muscle and/or strength loss is increased when using a larger deficit.

You may need to adjust these numbers as youâ€™re losing body fat and weight. If you no longer lose weight at the rate of 1-1.5 lbs per week, lower your calorie intake by 8-10%. If you find youâ€™re losing weight too fast, increase your calories by 5-10%.

**Macro-nutrients**

To prevent muscle loss or sustain muscle gain, maintain healthy hormonal status and good gym perf

No processed food. Eat real food !

lean meats, vegetables, fruits and root vegetables allow us to eat a large quantity of food for little calories.

1g of Protein = 4 Kcal / 1g of Carbs = 4Kcal / 1g of Fat = 9Kcal

Fat Loss : (Protein, Fats, Carbs ratio)

Protein : **170g** (1g - 1.4g of protein per lb / 2.2g - 3g of protein per kg)

Fat : **45g** (25% of total calorie)

Carbs : **140g (**the rest**)**
