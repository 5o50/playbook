Pawn majority
When a player has more pawns on one side of the board than their opponent has on the same side, we call that a pawn majority. Pawn majorities usually have the potential to create a passed pawn.

Pawn promotion
- King on the 6th #1
- King on the 6th #2

Passed Pawns
What's even stronger than a passed pawn? A protected passed pawn!
Outside Passed Pawns #1
Outside Passed Pawns #2
Outside passed pawns can and should be sacrificed if doing so puts your king in a better resulting position than your opponent's king.

Strategy

When you see a good move, look for a better one !!!

(Tactics are the servants of strategy)
(in order for good tactics to appear, your pieces must be on good squares.)
 this requires knowing where your pieces belong and some understanding of how to get them there despite your opponent's best effort to stop you.

improving your pieces leads to better tactical opportunities which, in turn, will help you win the game.

Tactics are the basic weapons with which you win games in chess and the more you have in your arsenal, the better. Now you have a solid grasp of some of the basic ones which can occur very frequently in your games.

 Outpost
 move knight at the center of the board
 An outpost is a square that is an ideal perch for a piece (often a knight) from which to control the board undisturbed. A square is an outpost if it is:
A. Supported by a friendly pawn and
B. unable to be attacked by an enemy pawn

 Active Piece vs. Passive Piece
 It's always better to have more active pieces than your opponent. By definition, a piece that is further in enemy territory and/or attacking key squares and pieces is active

 Pawn Weaknesses
 1. Doubled pawns: Highlighted in green, doubled pawns are bad because they step on each other's toes and cannot defend one another, unlike the white pawns on a2 and b2. A healthy pawn structure is usually composed of pawns which are able to fluidly move up the board side by side and help each other along the way. Doubled pawns, therefore, are more vulnerable to attack because they cannot defend each other.
 2. Isolated pawns: Highlighted in red, an isolated pawn is one that can never be supported by a pawn next to it. Here, since the c- and e-pawns are both absent, the d-pawn is isolated and therefore a target for an enemy piece.
 3. Backward pawns: Highlighted in yellow, backward pawns are similar to isolated pawns in that, for the moment, they are unable to be defended by an adjacent pawn. Moving them forward would allow them to be captured. Because they are immobilized by the white g-pawn, you may even consider the white g-pawn more valuable than the black h-, g-, and f-pawns combined. Backward pawns are particularly vulnerable to attack because of their immobility.
