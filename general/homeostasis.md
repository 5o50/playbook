> Each of these variables is controlled by one or more regulators or homeostatic mechanisms, which together maintain life.
> regulated despite changes in the environment

a natural resistance to change in the optimal conditions,and equilibrium is maintained by many regulatory mechanisms. 

All homeostatic control mechanisms have at least three interdependent components for the variable being regulated: 

## Receptor
receptor is the sensing component that monitors and responds to changes in the environment, either external or internal (thermoreceptors, and mechanoreceptors)

## Control Centre
Control centres include the respiratory centre, and the renin–angiotensin system
Some centers, such as the renin–angiotensin system, control more than one variable. When the receptor senses a stimulus, it reacts by sending action potentials to a control center. The control center sets the maintenance range—the acceptable upper and lower limits—for the particular variable, such as temperature. The control center responds to the signal by determining an appropriate response and sending signals to an effector, which can be one or more muscles, an organ, or a gland. When the signal is received and acted on, negative feedback is provided to the receptor that stops the need for further signaling.[4]

## Effector
An effector is the target acted on, to bring about the change back to the normal state.
