Intelligence
===

intelligence is being able to see the big picture.


If you want to understand the causes that existed in the past, look at the results as they are manifested in the present.
And if you want to understand what results will be manifested in the future, look at the causes that exist in the present.


The medium is the message.

The map is not the territory.
