Interview Somebody

Choose with gut feeling after:

**Tell me the story of your life, the decision you made along way and why you made them.**

**Tell me about some of the most difficult problem you worked on and how you solved them.**

The people that really solve the problem they know exactly how they solved them, and the people that pretended to solve the problem they can go one level and then they get stuck.
