FOCUS & FEEL — INTUITION

be gut brained / gut grounded

you have to pay attention to get it

“People tend to assess the relative importance of issues by the ease with which they are retrieved from memory—and this is largely determined by the extent of coverage in the media.“

“The situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer. Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition.”

“This is the essence of intuitive heuristics: when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution.“

The gorilla study illustrates two important facts about our minds: we can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness.

The best we can do is a compromise: learn to recognize situations in which mistakes are likely and try harder to avoid significant mistakes when the stakes are high. The premise of this book is that it is easier to recognize other people’s mistakes than our own.

This remarkable priming phenomenon—the influencing of an action by the idea—is known as the ideomotor effect.

The general theme of these findings is that the idea of money primes individualism: a reluctance to be involved with others, to depend on others, or to accept demands from others.

A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth.

Mood evidently affects the operation of System 1: when we are uncomfortable and unhappy, we lose touch with our intuition.

the mere exposure effect, the connection makes biological sense. A good mood is a signal that things are generally going well, the environment is safe, and it is all right to let one’s guard down. A bad mood indicates that things are not going very well, there may be a threat, and vigilance is required. Cognitive ease is both a cause and a consequence of a pleasant feeling.

**Let you intuition express — Unconditional Faith and trust in your observations**

THE SOLUTION IS RIGHT BEFORE OUR EYES — Sensibilité

empty mind — connect heart with soul and accept what you get.

Align you logical intelligence with your emotional intelligence.

Unconditional Faith in your guts

The quieter you become, the more you can hear.

**Practice Mindfulness and focus**

Align your empty mind, with your empathy. and get INTUITIVE INSIGHT.  THATS HOW WE UNDERSTAND.

**A quiet mind is able to hear intuition over fear.**

**Intuition — Beyond Logic And Reason**

Intuition comes from the observation of one's own mental and emotional processes. It is more of “feel” rather than “logic” — it's your ability to sense things before they hit you

Intuition is the supra-logic that cuts out all the routine processes of thought and leaps straight from the problem to the answer.

“Intuition doesn’t tell you what you want to hear; it tells you what you need to hear.”

**Difference Between Intuition And Fear**

Intuition lead towards a path that makes us feel comfortable, even if we are not certain

dictates a decision that makes us feel relieved

Instead, use your intuition when you are calm, not rushed and have time to think things over.
