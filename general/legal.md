**#4 LEGAL**
    - Work with regulators. As numerous law/economics scholars have pointed out, market solutions appear to underprovide privacy and regulation can help tweak the environment to address this imbalance. Those who wish to see the personal data ecosystem flourish would do well to support regulatory interventions such as transparency and opt-out that can help level the playing field between centralized and decentralized systems.
    - Incorporate other notions of regulability. Many decentralized systems represent an extreme choice: they seek to achieve privacy and other properties purely through technology, ignoring socio-legal approaches. This extreme may not be optimal.
