# Link building

Build trust and authority relationshipsfrom other websites

The process of building relationships with site owners
who want and will link to your content, because it helps
to enhance their own. Hyperlinks from other websites linking
to yours is called a backlink.

They are a ranking signal, search engines use them to decide
where a page deserved to be ranked in search results.

Each backlink is a "vote" for the value and quality of your page.


MORE BACKLINKS + QUALITY OF THOSE BACKLINKS 
= EASIER TO RANK HIGHER IN THE SEARCH RESULTS PAGES
= MORE TRAFFIC TO YOUR WEBSITE


=> HAVING BACKLINKS ARE A MUST TO RANK FOR COMPETITIVE KEYWORDS
=> COMPETITIVE KEYWORDS ARE USUALLY THE ONES THAT DRIVE THE MOST TRAFFIC AND REVENUE FOR YOUR BUSINESS

## What makes a backlink "GOOD" and "HIGH QUALITY"?
not all backlinks are created equal.
backlink from a forum hold less weight than a backlink from a news website like the New York Times.

WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT: 
anyone can add a backlink to a forum BUT very few people can add a backlink to a news website like the New York Times.
So those backlinks are NOT THE SAME.

These are the factors that qualify a GOOD backlink:
- Relevance: The backlink is from a website that is relevant to your niche or industry.
- Authoritativeness: The backlink is from a website that is known for its authority and credibility.
  How much "link power" we webpage has. ITS BIGGEST IMPACT ON RANKINGS look at DA Domain Authority to see the overall strength of a website's backlink profile
- Anchor text: The backlink uses the keyword you want to rank for in the anchor text.
  The text that appears highlighted in a hyperlink and that can be clicked
  helps search engines understand what a page is about and what terms it should rank for
  aside from keywords you can use brand name, title of the page, URL, or CTAs.
  Ideally some of your anchor text should have your target keywords
- Rel attribute: The backlink has a rel="nofollow" or rel="sponsored" attribute value to the <a> tag.
  Help tell search engines about the relationship between the linking page and the linked page.
  Its better for your backlink to not have a rel attribute, its considered a followed link that would allow to pass ranking credit and boost your credit.
  If there is a rel attribute then its google discretion to decide if it should pass ranking credit or not.
  The three are "nofollow", "ugc", and "sponsored".
  "sponsored": to identify links on your site that were created as part of advertisements, sponsorships, or other compensation agreements.
  "ugc": to identify links on your site that were created as part of user-generated content such as comments, reviews, or forum posts.
  "nofollow": for cases where you want to link to a page but don't want to imply any type of endorsement, including passing along ranking credit to another page
- Link placement: The placement of a link on a page is important, because the more prominent or higher up it is, the more important it is and a higher chance it will get clicked on.


## Strategies to get backlinks

### 1. Create the backlinks

Manually add links on a domain pointing back to yours:
- Adding your link on various directories: Yelp, etc
- Commenting on peoples blogs posts
- Social media profiles

Search engine will not consider those links important.
But still good because it adds to your overall profile.
Even though then will not help you rank higher in search results.
But every business does it so its natural to do it too.

Difficulty: EASY
Effectiveness: LOW



### 2. Buy the backlinks

Pay website owners to add your backlink to their website.
CAREFUL: Google penalizes websites that buy backlinks as Link Spam.
https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies
Yet: Google does understand that buying and selling links is normal
part of the economy of the web for advertising and sponsorship purposes.
It's not a violation or our policies to have suck links as long as they are qualified
with a rel="nofollow" or rel="sponsored" attribute value to the <a> tag.

Difficulty: EASY
Effectiveness: VARIES

You don't know who you're buying from, they might have a spammy domain 
or they might be selling hundreds of thousands of backlinks to others as well.
CAN BE SPAMMY IF YOU DONT DO YOUR DUE DILIGENCE
ONLY DEAL WITH REPUTABLE WEBMASTERS YOU CAN TRUST
AND DOMAIN THAT ARE RELEVANT TO YOUR KINDS OF TOPICS AND CONTENT
