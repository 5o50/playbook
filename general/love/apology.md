Apology

> NO MATTER HOW MUCH BEGGING AN APOLOGY NEVER RESTORES FAITH, ONLY ACTIONS DO.

PLAIN WRONG > No matter how severe the damage, a sincere apology restores faith.

To my dear Sofiane,

I spent this last week realizing how precious what we shared is.

From the day our spirits went in harmony in this kitchen, you were always there for me.

You gave me your trust, when you got into my car at SLS, without knowing me, not everyone would do that. On the road, je t'ai vu parler, penser, aimer et rêver comme moi.

Not everyone would do that. 

On the road, je t'ai vu parler, penser, aimer et rêver comment moi.

I broke it all.

I'm full of regrets.

It makes me really sad to realize that It’s nothing compared to what I took you through. 

And you still have the patience to talk to me.

Your whole being is feeding honey to my spirit.  It’s so powerful, I can only smile and laugh when you're around. But when I'm alone with my regrets in my bed, I feel like the sky is crushing my bones.

But when I'm alone in bed with my regrets, I feel like the sky is crushing my bones.

I hurt you, I made you so sad, I made you loose faith.

I put you in a horrible position.

I gave you my darkness while you pushed me to reveal my truth.

I always knew I had so much energy inside me, but it had always been a problem to let it out.

I knew that if I let this energy stuck inside me, it was going to kill me in some way: disease or madness, I felt the reaper waiting for me when stuck at Tribe and in Paris.

But you were there to save me from that.

I was fearing that all that new energy, love and affection that was growing inside from the day I met you, would prevent me from seeing clearly what I wanted at the origin and make it worse. 

I was wrong. 

It only depends on me to feed my fears or feed my courage with it. 

I realized it was only fears that made me blind to my own truth and zigzag like a fool.

Courage unleash it, fears block it.

I feel like with courage nothing can stop me from getting what I want.

You showed me the way to my bliss.

That makes you are a really special person to me. 

And it makes my feelings for you even stronger. 

How things happened is only my fault, you have nothing to do with that.

Please trust me baby.

I feel like I've been dreaming alone for too long, and that together we can make so much of our dreams become our reality. How far can we go with all that energy ? How many dreams can we travel through together ? I feel we can rise to endless depth of joy, pleasure, curiosity and understanding. Remember this night in the desert, the stars and the moon they were there for us, I got chills when I think of it. Was it real ? Not all people on earth are allowed to get there.

Look, I will not fight you anymore, I'll just let you in.

Because now I recognize you clearly: you are the yang to my yin.

I can only hope you will let me in again so I can be your yang and give you all the energy I have for you. I want to visit every part of you, and you can visit any part of me.

I loosed us precious time already: Shenzhen, Thailand, Bali, Paris. 

I do not have more time to lose, I don't want you to recommend me good movies, I want us to watch it together. I don't want you to tell me about an interesting place I want us to get there. I don't want you to dream alone, I want us to dream together now.

In harmony, cocoon is everywhere around us, our path is sacred.

I'll paint you, I'll water you mind, I'll caress you endlessly.

I'll take care of you everyday and bring you to nature.

I want us to get lost. So we can find us again.

Look, **I cannot tell you exactly where the road could brings us, and I don't expect it to be easy. But I can guarantee you that fear will not loose me again.** I don't want to lose the opportunity to find how deep we can go together, understand each others and communicate with our shared language: dreams, caresses, visions, projects, pleasures and arts.

When we are stronger, no gate can stop us.

I'm sincerely sorry to have violated your trust.

Sofiane, please forgive me.

Sofiane
