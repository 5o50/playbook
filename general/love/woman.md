From a females point of view, I say yes whilst I can understand guys saying and thinking a beautiful girl is one they cannot approach, its a question really you should have directed at we females, not other guys, who probably feel the same as you, apprehensive of approaching a good looking girl for fear of rejection. Well Honey I am going to tell you a few things about we women, that may help you get over this fear of yours (fear perhaps not the right word), but apprehension of approaching what you see as the untouchables.

1.) Unless a girl is known to be a big headed conceited arrogant female, only going out with certain guys for their looks, status and money, then do not be scared of approaching a pretty girl or one that you see as overly pretty. YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH FOR ANYONE.

2.) Don't judge the female just on her looks, watch the way she interacts with her girlfriends around her, is she happy go lucky, is she smiling a lot, get closer, listen to the way she speaks, look if you can to see the inner side of her. You soon get to know and recognize the ones who are out and out bitches.

3.) Remember on approaching a girl you do not know, that because you would like to speak to her, it does not mean to her that you want to go out with her necessarily, you could be just a friendly type of guy, so approach the opposite sex as if you were just making a new friend of her, it takes the pressure off you and will make it easier to start getting to know the girl.

FACT

Beauty and brains don't necessarily go hand in hand, often these air head types, the ones who are out and about only to be seen on the right guys arms, are often the nasty ones, but also they are air heads, and don't have one intelligent thing to say, used to be called ' dumb blonde's', but that's unfair to say now, as lots of girls are bottled blonde's these days, including we older women, with daughters and nieces of our own, and who know how girls of even to day feel about guys.

If a girl is pretty or beautiful, well that is only a gift, a lucky gift fair enough that she was born with, but the true beauty will on the nicer type of girl, be both on the outside and the inside too. That's why I say study these buddies, differentiate them from the air head kinds, and make a move. Besides, whilst only a saying '' beauty is in the eye of the beholder'' its a very true fact, and besides why are or would a guy knock himself down think a girl is approachable just because she is good looking, surely you realize she has opinions too, she may well find you attractive too.

Tut Tut to you young men of today, here's Aunty Billie having to step in, and give you a push in the right direction, but seriously Honey, attractions work both ways, don't be fearful of approaching a girl that seems out of your league, no one is, and no one should feel that way, your as good if not better than other people, come on now, a bit more self assurance about yourself, do I have to fly over there and knock your heads together, and share my knowledge with your friends.

When I was younger, I always used to say to myself '' I am glad I was born a girl, I would hate to be rejected if I had been a boy when I asked someone out'', so you see, I do know and understand where your coming from. But as a female myself, I soon got mentally mature enough to realize that whilst looks may attract initially, looks on their own do not keep a relationship going, its you and she being compatible with one another, having similar natures and personalities that keep relations alive and kicking.

Remember too, approach them with a slightly couldn't care less attitude, see them as potential friends first, it will relax you, if chemistry is going to ignite, it will, leave it up to good old mother nature, if something is meant to be, it will be - believe me I know that, have lived long enough to see it happen again and again.

Last but not least, if you think your not good enough, you will act that way, so stop doing that if you do OK, and remember looks are not the only things that attract, its the way you come across to them, girls like guys to sound sure of themselves, even if your only pretending, start listening to guys that are full of confidence, and learn from them - that after all is how the girls learn to approach or talk to the guys anyway.

Next time you see a girl you're apprehensive of talking to, study her first, then approach, if its in the environment of say school of college, then already you got something to talk about anyway, and see her as possibly just a new friend, don't put added stress on yourself, just try it, and I bet you will be surprised at the result.
