dont find a girl

1. You don’t find a girl. You create a lifestyle.
2. You don’t find a girl. You create meaning in your life
3. You don’t find a girl. You let go of control and lead with courage for your mind to absorb many experiences.
4. You don’t find a girl. You come to the edge because there is no right time, right moment and when you’re ready. It’s an illusion, You can read thousands of books but it won’t help you succeed alone. **“That which you cannot GROW through, you shall go through again and again..”**You don’t grow in the comfort zone. Step forward to the edge. That is where you will grow faster.
5. You don’t find a girl. You create opportunities in places that you like and where there are many girls that go there to engage with as you do whatever you are doing anyway.
6. You don’t find a girl. You create value to connect etc.
7. You don’t find a girl. You create boundaries so that if any girls wants your time, resources s a friend, show her the line and if she cross it, you can say to her with an awesome smile to…kiss your ass goodbye.
8. In other words improve on one’s self worth, create the lifestyle you want and that will create the opportunities anyway to attract abundance of girls in your life to date.

Have Shared Values

It's crucially important in any relationship that you share core values and principles, so it's no surprise that shared values was a key attribute that many women mentioned. This doesn't mean being the exact same person or having the same opinion on everything; rather, it's about having the same basic idea of wrong and right, even if you quibble about the surface-level details.

"You don't have to be two peas in a pod but you need to be growing in the same garden," Charlotte says. "Shared values are really the foundation of a relationship. This isn't a fake it 'til you make it scenario, either: you should know what you value, so make it known. As long as there are more hits than misses it will work. The idea isn't to mould into but rather compliment each other, and shared values serves this purpose perfectly."

This is an area to clear up pretty early in the relationship. It's okay if you have different political and philosophical views, but if she's a diehard socialist and you're an arch capitalist, for example -- or if she's a staunch atheist and you're a committed Christian -- you're going to need to talk seriously and frankly about whether you have enough shared ground to make things work. Make sure you both agree on the right way to live and what counts as good and bad behavior, and you shouldn't go too far wrong.
