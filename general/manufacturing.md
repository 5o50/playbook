CHINA MODEL FACTORY ON ALIBABA !!!
We are mainly in the battery business. If you need an alloy shell, you need a model factory
It may be a little difficult to find the corresponding mill in Alibaba
These factories are usually for the internal market
How many aluminum cases do you need to customize?
We have cooperation with aluminum alloy shell suppliers, but the ODM products need a certain MOQ
The ODM shell need to pay for the model cost
The number of hundreds is too small and the cost will be high

    A textile is a flexible material consisting of a network of natural or artificial fibers. Yarn is produced by spinning raw fibres of wool, flax, cotton, hemp, or other materials to produce long strands. Textiles are formed by weaving, knitting, crocheting, knotting or tatting, felting, or braiding.

I'm using the Steba KB11 as reflow oven in combination with a reflow controller. It ramps up round about 1Â°C/sec. The thermal switch is a bit annoying on multiple runs because you have to let it cool down quite a bit or it will stop heating while ramping up. Btw your Volume is wrong it 8 L (so 125 W/L). But i have to admit that i'm only using this oven to reflow my own PCBs and not for repairing motherboards.

I used a converted toaster oven for years.  It was fine, but was a pain when I had to run through 10 or 20 PCBs that would not all fit into the oven.  I looked around and bought a Puhui T-960 (http://puhuit.com/main/page_products_t960_reflow_oven.html) and I have never looked back nor have I used by old converted toaster oven.  Basic specs are:
- 5 Zone comprised of 3 up and 2 down
- Just over 3 feet in length weighing about 200 lbs
- Needs 220VAC single phase or can be wired for higher 3-phase voltages
- I paid about $1200 for the unit with about $600 shipping... about $2K by the time I had it in my hands.
For the table, I welded one out of metal so that there would be no issues with regards to supporting the weight or residual temp issues.  Also I added ducting to exhaust any fumes that might result.
The only real caveat is that it takes about 10 minutes to come up to temp, but it works fantastic and allows me to continually run as many PCBs I like.  I have used it with 2/4/6 layer PCBs with fine pitch (0.5mm) LQFP/QFN, BGA (0.65mm), and 0603/0402 parts with no issues.  If anything I may tweak the various zone temps or conveyor speeds depending upon the solder paste, etc.  Overall I am very pleased with the unit and it certainly addresses my PCB needs from 1 to 50 at a time.
Cheers,
Sam

Finish
https://www.pcbway.com/pcb_prototype/Comparison_of_several_PCB_surface_finish_types.html	
* If you have thin tracks (<25 thou) then itâ€™s nice to add a â€œchamferâ€ to any â€œTâ€ junctions, thus eliminating any 90 degree angles. This makes the track more physically robust, and prevents any potential manufacturing etching problems. But most importantly, it looks nice	
Finish Touches	
## Surface Finishies
* You can get your PCB manufactured with several different types of pad and track surface finish.
* Very low cost single and double sided boards without solder mask typically have a basic tin coated finish. Beware of potential shorts between tracks with this method
* Your standard professionally manufactured board will typically have solder mask over bare copper (SMOBC) tracks, and a tin finish on the pads and vias which is Hot Air Leveled (HAL). Hot air leveling helps most surface mount components to sit flat on the board
* For large and critical surface mount components, a gold â€œflashâ€ finish is used on the pads. This gives an extremely flat surface finish for dense fine pitch devices
* Peelable solder masks are available, and are handy for temporary masking of areas on your board during wave soldering or conformal coating	
Going  from  1  to  10  PCBâ€™s  doesnt  even  double  the  price  and most of the times when you need 1 or 2 PCBâ€™s getting 5 PCBâ€™s is not that much more in price but having an extra PCB can be a big time saver in case something goes wrong with the first PCB	
If a PCB is possible to route with 6 layer but they can use 8 layers the price of design will be lower but of course the price of manufacturing the PCB will be higher.	
A 4 layer PCB with the same specifications is aboute130 each ore330 for 10 pieces.  For ahobbyist these prices are to high in most cases.  For small PCBâ€™s, smaller then 7.5 by 7.5cmthere are two cheaper manufacturers.  batchPCBoffers 0.15 clearance and trace thickness with4 layer PCBâ€™s for 8 dollars per square inch + 10 dollars setup fee.  You get 1 or 2 PCBâ€™s butit can take a while before they arrive.  DorkbotPDXuses the same design rules but a slightlydifferent pricing.  4 layer PCBâ€™s are 10 dollars per square inch but they donâ€™t have any setupfee.  For that you get 3 PCBâ€™s in purple instead of green.  The last option is Iteadstudio, theyhave one affordable option, 10 pieces of 10*10cm 4 layer boards for $ 99.  For all three the samedownsides apply, only 0.15mm clearance and trace thickness and it will take a while before theyarrive.  If this is no problem the prices are affordable compared to the bigger companies

The via hole size you have of 0.2mm(7.87mil) is also very small and needs to be around 0.3mm(11.8mil) to be more cost-effective in production.  Note that at these sizes the size does not affect the impedance significantly here.

For  small  quantities  this  is  veryexpensive, going from 8 to 12 layers can easily double the price but for very high density thiscan be necessary.

DIFFERENTIATE  NRE AND COST PER BOARD	
prototype hdi board (without via in pad)	
## Cost-effective manufacturing tips	
.  The prices can differa lot per PCB manufacturer and itâ€™s smart to check with multiple manufacturers what theirprices are.  In general, buried viaâ€™s or microviaâ€™s .  , smaller than thatcan be expensive and prices differ a lot between different PCB manufacturers.  A lot is possiblebut the prices will rise proportionally.	
## Submitting your design for manufacture	The first thing to know is which format to send your PCBfile in
Supplying the original PCB package file will ensure that what you see on the screen is what you will get when your board is delivered.
Unless you have a good reason to do so, donâ€™t supply your file in any other format
Gerber files are the traditional and industry recognised file format, all major manufacturers will accept them. Many PCBdesigners still insist on generating and supplying Gerber files themselves, in order to have total control over the manufacturing process. In all but a few extreme cases, generating Gerber files is not necessary and a thing of he past. Generating gerbers adds an extra step of complexity to the PCB process where errors can creep in. So avoid the use of gerber files were possible, they can be troublesome unless you know exactly how to generate them correctly.
Many manufacturers will have â€œprototypeâ€ services where they will fit as many of your boards onto a standard â€œpanelâ€ as they can, all for one fixed price. 
In most cases you will be charged a â€œtoolingâ€ cost. This is the cost of printing the photo masks for your board, and also setting up their machines. This is usually a one-off cost, so if you get the same board manufactured again, you wonâ€™t have to pay the tooling charge.
The manufacturer will ask for a lot of information before they quote, ask them what you need to provide with your file
A reference code and revision for your board. This makes it easy for both parties to track the progress of it
Desired manufacturing time, known as the â€œturn-aroundâ€. 24 hours will cost a LOT more than 2 weeks

Tooling Strips	Tooling Strips
Tooling strips are strips of blank board down the top and bottom side of your board. They contain tooling holes, fiducial marks, and other manufacturing information if required.
Standard tooling holes are required for automated handling of your board. 2.4mm and 3.2mm are two standard hole sizes. Four tooling holes per panel is sufficient, one in each corner.
The tooling trips connect to your board(s) with breakout tabs or V Grooves
Micro Via Structures:Cost Optimization: HDI design reduces overall cost by decreasing the number of layers and size as compared to a STANDARD TECHNOLOGY PCB design for the same level of complexity.Not only HDI design make the PCBs smaller, lighter, and thinner; but HDI PCBs provide a much superior electrical performance.

proper vias	Ensure that all your vias are identical, with the same pad and hole sizes. Remember your pad to hole ratio. Errors here can cause â€œbreakoutsâ€ in your via pad, where the hole, if shifted slightly can be outside of your pad. With plated through holes this is not always fatal, but without a complete annular ring around your hole, your via will be mechanically unreliable
4 and 8 layer boards are standard	
Signature - handwriting on boards	It is often handy to remove a small square of solder mask from the top of your board, where there are no tracks underneath. This leaves a nice bare and visible part of your board to write something with a pen.
Like any work of art, no board is complete without adding your name or signature to it!The signature can take any form your like. Some people put their name, initials, or a fancy symbol. Whatever it is, just make sure you add something. A signature can be placed on any of the copper layers, or on the silkscreen

COMMERCIAL SERVICE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES	
add teardrops	If you wish, add â€œteardropsâ€ to all your pads and vias. A teardrop is a nice â€œsmoothing outâ€ of the junction between the track and the pad, not surprisingly, shaped like a teardrop. This gives a more robust and reliable track to pad interface, better than the almost right angle between a standard track and pad. Donâ€™t add teardrops manually though, itâ€™s a waste of time. But if your program supports automatic teardrop placement, feel free to use it.
mounting holes	Check that you have any required mounting holes on the board. Keep mounting holes well clear of any components or tracks. Allow room for any washers and screws.

"ðŸ± Paneling
		https://www.pcbway.com/pcb_prototype/PCB_Panel_Creation.html"	Panelisation
If you are looking at getting your board automatically assembled with a pick-and-place machine, then it pays you to get as many boards onto the one â€œpanelâ€ as you can
A panel is simply a large PCB containing many identical copies of your board. It takes time to place a board into position on a pick and place machine, so the more boards you can load at once, the more cost effective your manufacturing will be.
A panel will also contain tooling strips on the top and bottom, to allow for automated handling of the panel. Different manufactuers may have different maximum panel sizes they can produce.
Each individual board can be â€œrouted outâ€ and joined with â€œbreakout tabsâ€, or simply butted together and scoured out with a â€œV grooveâ€. A V groove is a score mark placed on your board that allows you to easily â€œsnapâ€ the board along the groove. A breakout tab is a small strip of board perhaps 5-10mm long joining your board to your panel. Small non-plated holes are also drilled along this strip, which allows the board to be snapped or cut out of the panel after assembly.
You will need to consult your board loader to determine optimum panelisation size and requirements.
Whether or not you want electrical testing. This is pretty necessary for multi-layer boards.

Fiducial Marks	Fiducial marks are visual alignment aids placed on your PCB. They are used by automated pick and place machines to align your board and find reference points. A video camera on the machine can identify the center of fiducial marks and use these points as a reference.
On a panel there should be 3 fiducial marks, known as global fiducials. Bottom left/right and top left corners. They should be at least 5mm away from the board edges. They can be mounted on the tooling strips
The fiducial mark should be a circular pad on the copper layer of diameter 1.5mm typically. The fiducial should not be covered with solder mask, and the mask should be removed for a clearance of at least 3mm around. The pad can be bare copper or coated like a regular pad.
Two local fiducial (one in opposite corners) is also required next to each large fine pitch surface mount device package on your board

â€œIt's unwise to pay too much, but it's worse to pay too little. When you pay too much, you lose a little money -that's all. When you pay too little, you sometimes lose everything, because the thing you bought was incapable of doing the thing it was bought to do. The common law of business balance prohibits paying a little and getting a lot -it can't be done. If you deal with the lowest bidder, it is well to add something for the risk you run, and if you do that you willhave enough to pay for something better.â€John Ruskin (1819-1900)

In that case, extra costs and longer leading time is expected. but it hard to be specified without check the design file manually.	
Soldering Consideration	Soldering considerations need to taken into account when laying out your board
There are three basic soldering techniques - hand, wave, and reflow
Hand soldering is the traditional method typically used for prototypes and small production runs. Major impacts when laying out your board include suitable access for the iron, and thermal reflief for pads. Non-plated through double sided boards should allow for ample room to get the soldering iron onto the top side pads.
Wave soldering is a common process used for surface mount and through hole production soldering. It involves passing the entire board over a molten bath of solder. Solder masks are absolutely essential here to prevent bridging. The major thing to watch out for when designing is ensuring that small components are not in the wave solder â€œshadowâ€ of larger components. The board travels through the wave solder machine in one direction, so there will be a lack of solder trailing behind larger components. Surface mount devices are fixed to the board with an adhesive before wave soldering.
Reflow soldering is the latest technique, and is suitable for all surface mount components. The blank board is first coated with a mask of solder paste over the pads (solder â€œstencilsâ€ are used for this). Then each component is placed, and is sometimes held in place by an adhesive. The entire board is then loaded into an infrared or nitrogen oven and â€œbakedâ€. The solder paste melts (reflows) on the pads and component leads to make the joint. A newer reflow method called pin-in-paste or intrusive reflow is available for through hole devices
Combinations of wave and reflow soldering can be used for mixed through hole and surface mount boards.
Wave soldering has the advantage of being cheap, but the disadvantage of imposing placement limits on your components. Reflow soldering is more complex and expensive, but it allows for very dense surface mount packing

Minimise the number of hole sizes.	Extra hole sizes cost you money, as the manufacturer will charge you based on not only the number of holes in your boards, but the number of different hole sizes you have. It takes time for the very high speed drill to spin down, change drill bits, and then spin up again. Check with your manufacturer for these costs, but you canâ€™t go wrong by minimising the number of hole sizes.

You can have your finished PCB checked for electrical continuity and shorts at the time of manufacture. This is done with a automated â€œflying probeâ€ or â€œbed of nailsâ€ test machine. It checks that the continuity of the tracks matches your PCB file. It may cost a fair bit extra, but this is pretty mandatory for multi-layer boards. If you have a manufacturing error on one of your inner layers, it can be very difficult to fix.
