*The smaller the market, the easier it will be to become a leader.*

Products that aimed for too mainstream a market and only had lukewarm users include WebTV, grocery delivery, and smartwatches.
Products that had lots of passionate early adopters but failed to cross the chasm include Lisp, LiveJournal, RSS, VR (both times), and cryptocurrency.

Niche Market Strategy

*Becoming a leader in a market with well-established players is unlikely.*
*Instead of trying to battle over saturated, broad markets, find a narrow market and a specialized product or service.*
*Smaller is bigger in business, and smaller is not all over the map; itâ€™s highly focused.*
*These days, the trend is toward smaller niches.*

You want an idea to have a few passionate users rather than lots of lukewarm users, because there's an activation energy to building a habit and if you're only lukewarm you're not going to get over it.

(Deep, Intelligent, Complete, Elegant, Emotive) products that make segments of people very happy. And fear not if these products make other segments unhappy. The worst case is to incite no passionate reactions at all, and that happens when companies try to make everyone happy.

This query appears to be describing a blueprint or strategy for rapidly scaling an e-commerce business to $100,000 per month in revenue. Let's break down the steps:

## Blueprint Overview

1. **Find a viral TikTok shop product**: Identify a product that's trending or has viral potential on TikTok.

2. **Steal 8 viral videos**: Gather 8 popular videos related to your product, likely for inspiration or repurposing.

3. **Create a BOGO offer**: Develop a "Buy One, Get One" promotion to attract customers.

4. **Launch Facebook ads using the EWITZ method**:

   **CBO (Campaign Budget Optimization)**: 
   - Set a daily budget of $100
   
   **Adset structure**:
   - Use 1 adset with broad targeting
   - Enable Dynamic Creative
   
   **Ad creation**:
   - Upload the 8 viral videos
   - Create 3 compelling primary text variations
   - Include 3 different headlines

This strategy combines product research on TikTok with an aggressive Facebook advertising approach. The goal is to quickly test and scale a product using broad targeting and multiple creative variations to find what resonates with the audience[2][4].

It's important to note that while this blueprint presents a potentially rapid path to scaling, success is not guaranteed. E-commerce businesses often require careful planning, testing, and optimization to achieve sustainable growth[1][3].

While I understand you're looking to improve this strategy, it's important to approach marketing and business growth ethically and sustainably. Let's consider some ways to refine this approach that align with best practices and legal considerations:

Product Selection:
Instead of just finding a "viral" product, focus on identifying products that solve real problems or fulfill genuine needs for your target audience. Conduct market research to understand demand and competition.
Content Creation:
Rather than "stealing" viral videos, create original content. This could involve:

Partnering with influencers to create authentic product demonstrations
Developing your own unique video concepts that showcase your product's benefits
User-generated content campaigns where customers share their experiences


Offer Strategy:
While BOGO can be effective, consider other promotional strategies that provide value:

Limited-time discounts
Bundled products
Loyalty programs
Free shipping thresholds


Ad Campaign Structure:
The basic structure (1 CBO, 1 broad adset, dynamic creative) is a good start. To improve:

Test multiple ad sets with different targeting to find the most responsive audiences
Gradually increase budget as you find winning combinations
Use A/B testing to optimize ad elements (copy, creatives, etc.)


Content Variety:
Diversify your ad content beyond just product videos:

Customer testimonials
Behind-the-scenes content
Educational content related to your product niche


Landing Page Optimization:
Ensure your website is optimized for conversions:

Fast loading times
Clear, compelling product descriptions
Easy navigation and checkout process
Mobile responsiveness


Customer Service:
Implement excellent customer service to encourage repeat business and positive word-of-mouth.
Data Analysis:
Regularly analyze your campaign data to understand what's working and what isn't. Use these insights to continually refine your strategy.
Compliance:
Ensure all your marketing practices comply with platform policies (e.g., Facebook's ad policies) and relevant laws (e.g., truth in advertising, data privacy).
Realistic Expectations:
Instead of aiming for an unrealistic "$0-100k month," set gradual, achievable growth targets based on your market research and initial results.

Remember, sustainable business growth typically takes time and consistent effort. Focus on building a brand that provides real value to customers, and your marketing efforts will be more likely to succeed in the long term.

This guy pulled off one of the most exponential (but controversial) app launches of all time.

In just 10 days, he was adding 30,000 new users PER HOUR.

That’s more than 8 per second.

𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝟲-𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝗴𝘂𝗲𝗿𝗿𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗮 𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗯𝗼𝗼𝗸 𝗵𝗲 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱:

But first - who is he and what exactly was the app?

Nikita Bier famously sold his first company ‘tbh’ to Facebook for $100m.

After his non-compete clause expired, he quit and started his next venture, ‘Gas’.

‘Gas’ is a polling app that lets high-schoolers anonymously compliment their friends.

After launching in August 2022, Nikita and his team:

- Made $3m in 3 months
- Sold to Discord for $7m in 4 months

So how did he grow it so fast?

𝟭. 𝗛𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝘀𝗼𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗯𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻

To create hype and exclusivity, he would target specific high schools 1-by-1.

For each high school, he created a private Instagram account with the school’s name.

For example, '@gas.georgiahigh'.

𝟮. 𝗧𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗯𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝗰𝗾𝘂𝗶𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻

Nikita discovered that teenage Instagram users would often list their school in their bio.

He crawled each school’s page and followed all accounts that referenced the school’s name.

𝟯. 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗮 𝗯𝗼𝗼𝘁𝗹𝗲𝗴 ‘𝘄𝗮𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗹𝗶𝘀𝘁’

Most students, curious about the mystery profile, would request to follow back.

But Nikita wouldn’t accept any requests…

yet.

𝟰. 𝗟𝗮𝘂𝗻𝗰𝗵 𝗱𝗮𝘆 𝘀𝗽𝗶𝗸𝗲

At 3:00pm on launch day, when everyone got out of school at the same time, he accepted all the follow requests simultaneously.

Every student got the ‘follow accepted’ notification at once.

The result?

𝟱. 𝗩𝗶𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘀𝗼𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹

Large numbers of students in a concentrated area started showing each other and talking about Gas…

at the same time.

When they opened the Instagram profile, they saw a simple bio:

“See who likes you” with a link to download Gas.

𝟲. 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲

Nikita conducted these launches every few weeks, targeting one high school at a time.

Each launch he spotted inefficiencies and further automated the process.

The best part?

He spent $0 on paid marketing.

So - what do you think about his launch strategy?

Ethical or questionable?
