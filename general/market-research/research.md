1/ spot a niche problem (use reddit, discord)
ex: "golfers struggle with swing consistency"

2/ cruise throug github issues of popular repos unsolved problems = startup opportunities

3/ validate with data (google trends, glimpse) look for steady 5-year growth, not spikes

4/ focus on "forgotten" demographics 
ie: often overlooked/underserved in tech (eg: military spouses, immigrants grandparents etc)

5/ run $50 facebook ad tests cheap way to validate before building (i call this marketing r&d)

6/ build a dead simple microsaas one feature > bloated app (spend $5000 or less to build mvp, ok if its ugly to start)

7/ create a "velvet rope" launch fomo + exclusivity = organic growth (95% of mvps in 2024 could be a social account/group chat + waitlist)

8/ get 100 conversations (with minmax ai for cold email)
"what's your biggest pain around X?"

9/ bake virality into your product give users incentive to share (extra features, credits) make sharing as frictionless as possible

10/ iterate based on actual usage hotjar + fullstory = gold for user insights

11/ leverage "exit intent" popups for eal feedback "why are you leaving?" teels you what's missing

12/ word of mouth > ads make 10 users love you, they'll bring 100 more

13/ partner with 100 microcreations or be a full-on creator yourself (or both)

14/ show the behind the schenes, build in public but you dont need to share veerything

15/ dont raise vc unless you really need to or want to (can always raise later as youre scaling)

congrats, you've got a 2024/205 startup playbook
