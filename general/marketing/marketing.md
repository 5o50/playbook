You need to pass through the four great fitlers of marketing:
- to be noticed
- to be remembered
- to be remembered in buying situtations
- to be talked about

HOW TO REACH OUR CUSTOMERS
through which channels do our customers segments wnat to be reached ?

What type of relationship does each of our customer sgement expect us to establish and maintain with them ?

â€œYou must recognize that you canâ€™t do business with everybody,â€

ðŸŒ THINK GLOBAL, ACT LOCAL (LOCAL + GLOBAL = GLOCAL)

**1 - Identify the target** â€” With whom do you want to do business? Be as specific as you can. 
*If you donâ€™t know whom you want to do business with, you canâ€™t make contact. Otherwise, you risk exhausting yourself and confusing your customers.*
- geographic range
 - types of customers:
- Targeting teenagers isnâ€™t specific enough; targeting male, African American teenagers with family incomes of $40,000 and up is.
- Aiming at companies that sell software is too broad; aiming at Northern California-based companies that provide internet software sales and training and have sales of $15 million or more is a better goal.
2 - **Focus Process** â€” Clarify what you want to sell â€” â€œmaternity clothes for executive women.â€
Your niche isn't the same as the field in which you work â€” a retail clothing business is not a niche but a field
- you canâ€™t be all things to all people
- smaller is bigger
- Make a list of things you do best and the skills implicit in each of them.
- List your achievements.
- Identify the most important lessons you've learned in life.
- Look for patterns that reveal your style or approach to resolving problems.
- Your niche should arise naturally from your interests and experience. For example, if you spent 10 years working in a consulting firm but also spent 10 years working for a small, family-owned business, you may decide to start a consulting business that specializes in small, family-owned companies.
**3. Describe the customerâ€™s worldview.**
â€œDo unto others as they would do unto themselves.â€
When you look at the world from your prospective customersâ€™ perspective, you can identify their needs or wants. The best way to do this is to talk to prospective customers and identify their main concerns.
**4. Synthesize & Evaluate**
At this stage, your niche should begin to take shape as your ideas and the clientâ€™s needs and wants coalesce to create something new. A good niche has five qualities:
- It takes you where you want to goâ€”in other words, it conforms to your long-term vision.
- Somebody else wants itâ€”namely, customers.
- Itâ€™s carefully planned.
- Itâ€™s one-of-a-kind, the â€œonly game in town.â€
- It evolves, allowing you to develop different profit centers and still retain the core business, thus ensuring long-term success.
 - Now itâ€™s time to evaluate your proposed product or service against the five criteria in Step 4. Perhaps youâ€™ll find that the niche you had in mind requires more business travel than youâ€™re ready for. That means it doesnâ€™t fulfill one of the above criteriaâ€”it wonâ€™t take you where you want to go. So scrap it, and move on to the next idea.


 Pay heed to conceptual fidelity. Are you shooting at the right target? Do people have the values you think they do? Do they really want the features/benefits you claim they want? As one example, there have been a multiple of projects that attempt encrypted communication over Facebook and other social networks (NOYB [22], FlyByNight [32], Lockr [53], FaceCloak [33], Scramble! [7], etc.), but the lack of adoption suggests that the usability costs do not outweigh the benefits to users.

 THERE IS NO AVERAGE USERS. PERSONAS DOESNT EXIST. HAVE GENUINE COMPASSION FOR THE USER. EVERY USER IS DIFFERENT
 
 - **External Image Matters more than function**
     - PEOPLE ARE GOING TO USE THE PRODUCT IN PUBLIC. Packaging matters.
     - People donâ€™t buy the product for itâ€™s functionality but for its self-expressive benefits, itâ€™s brand image.
 - In human sexual selection strategy a product that will increase your reproductive success will always win over one that mainly represent functionality (survival).
