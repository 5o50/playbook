- **Rhino6** + Grasshoper
  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoceros_3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoceros_3D)
  **Rhinoceros** (typically abbreviated **Rhino**, or **Rhino3D**) is a [commercial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_software) [3D computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics_software) and [computer-aided design (CAD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design) application software developed by [Robert McNeel & Associates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McNeel_%26_Associates), an American, privately held, [employee-owned company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_stock_ownership_plan) founded in 1980. Rhinoceros geometry is based on the [NURBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline) mathematical model, which focuses on producing mathematically precise representation of curves and [freeform surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeform_surface) in [computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics) (as opposed to [polygon mesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_mesh)-based applications).
  Rhinoceros is used in processes of computer-aided design (CAD), [computer-aided manufacturing (CAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_manufacturing), [rapid prototyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_prototyping), [3D printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing) and [reverse engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering) in industries including [architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture), [industrial design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_design) (e.g. [automotive design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_design), [watercraft design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipbuilding)), [product design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_design) (e.g. [jewelry design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewelry_design)) as well as for [multimedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia) and [graphic design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_design).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoceros_3D#cite_note-2)
  Rhinoceros is developed for the [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) operating system and [OS X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS). A visual [scripting language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language) add-on for Rhino, [Grasshopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasshopper_3D), is developed by Robert McNeel & Associates.
  Rhinoceros is primarily a free form surface modeler that utilizes the NURBS mathematical model. Rhinoceros' application architecture and open SDK makes it modular and enables the user to customize the interface and create custom commands and menus. There are dozens of plug-ins available from both McNeel and other software companies that complement and expand Rhinoceros' capabilities in specific fields like rendering and animation, architecture, marine, jewelry, engineering, prototyping, and others.[3]
- SolidWorks (CAD/CAE)
  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SolidWorks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SolidWorks)
  **SolidWorks** is a [solid modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_modeling) [computer-aided design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design) (CAD) and [computer-aided engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_engineering) (CAE) [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) that runs on [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows). SolidWorks is published by [Dassault SystÃ¨mes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dassault_Syst%C3%A8mes).
  According to the publisher, over two million [engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineers) and designers at more than 165,000 companies were using SolidWorks as of 2013.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SolidWorks#cite_note-2) Also according to the company, [fiscal year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year)2011â€“12 [revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue) for SolidWorks totalled [$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Dollar)483 million.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SolidWorks#cite_note-3)
- FreeCAD
  [https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Feature_list](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Feature_list)
  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCAD)
  FreeCAD is a free and open-source (under the LGPLv2+ license) general-purpose parametric 3D CAD modeler and a building information modeling (BIM) software with finite-element-method (FEM) support. FreeCAD is aimed directly at mechanical engineering product design but also expands to a wider range of uses around engineering, such as architecture or electrical engineering. FreeCAD can be used interactively, or its functionality can be accessed and extended using the Python programming language and is currently in a beta stage of development.
  FreeCAD features tools similar to [Autodesk Revit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_Revit), [CATIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CATIA), [Creo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creo_(design_software)), [Autodesk Inventor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_Inventor), [SolidWorks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SolidWorks) or [Solid Edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_Edge), and therefore also falls into the category of [Building Info Modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_Information_Modeling)(BIM), Mechanical computer-aided design (MCAD), [PLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_lifecycle_management), CAx and [CAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_engineering). It is intended to be a feature-based [parametric modeler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_modeling#Parametric_modeling) with a modular software architecture, which makes it easy to provide additional functionality without modifying the core system.
  As with many modern 3D CAD modelers, it will have a 2D component in order to extract design details from the 3D model to create 2D production drawings, but direct 2D drawing (like [AutoCAD LT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD#AutoCAD_LT)) is not the focus, neither are animation or organic shapes (like [Blender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)), [Maya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_Maya), [3ds Max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3ds_Max) or [Cinema 4D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_4D)), although, thanks to its wide adaptability, FreeCAD might become useful in a much broader area than its current focus.
  FreeCAD is intended to make use of other open-source libraries from the field of [scientific computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_computing). Among them are [Open CASCADE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_CASCADE) (a [CAD kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAD_kernel)), [Coin3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin3D) (an incarnation of [Open Inventor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Inventor)), the [Qt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(framework)) GUI framework, and [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), a popular scripting language. FreeCAD itself can also be used as a library by other programs.
  There are moves to take FreeCAD into the [architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture), [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering) and [construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction) (AEC) sector and add [building information modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling) (BIM) functionality with the Arch Module.
- **OpenSCAD**
  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSCAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSCAD)
  OpenSCAD is a free software application for creating solid 3D CAD (computer-aided design) objects. It is a script-only based modeller that uses its own description language; parts can be previewed, but it cannot be interactively selected or modified by mouse in the 3D view. An OpenSCAD script specifies geometric primitives (such as spheres, boxes, cylinders, etc.) and defines how they are modified and combined (for instance by intersection, difference, envelope combination and Minkowski sums) to render a 3D model. As such, the program does constructive solid geometry (CSG). OpenSCAD is available for Windows, Linux and OS X.
  OpenSCAD allows a designer to create accurate 3D models and [parametric designs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_modeling#Parametric_modeling) that can be easily adjusted by changing the parameters.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSCAD#cite_note-5)
  OpenSCAD documents are human-readable scripts in plain ASCII text.
  As such, OpenSCAD is a programmer-oriented solid-modeling tool[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSCAD#cite_note-6) and has been recommended as an entry-level [CAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design) tool for designing [open-source hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware) such as scientific tools for research and education.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSCAD#cite_note-7)
  It is mostly used to design [3D printed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing) parts, which are exported in [STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)) format.
  Animation created with OpenSCAD
  Animation is possible with a speed of a few images per seconds for simple models. The animation can have effect on any parameter, being it the camera position or the parts dimensions, position, shape or existence. It can be recorded as a set of images usable to build films.
- CATIA (CAD/CAM/CAE/PLM/3D)
  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CATIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CATIA)
  CATIA (/kÉ™ËˆtiËÉ™/, an acronym of computer-aided three-dimensional interactive application) is a multi-platform software suite for computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), computer-aided engineering (CAE), PLM and 3D, developed by the French company Dassault SystÃ¨mes.
- Siemens NX (CAD/CAM/CAE)
  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_NX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_NX)
  **NX**, formerly known as "UG". In 2000 Unigraphics purchased **SDRC I-DEAS** and began an effort to integrate aspects of both software packages into a single product which became **Unigraphics NX** or **NX**. **NX** is an advanced high-end [CAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design)/[CAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_manufacturing)/[CAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_engineering), which has been owned since 2007 by [Siemens PLM Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_PLM_Software).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_NX#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_NX#cite_note-2)
  It is used, among other tasks, for:
  - [Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design) (parametric and direct solid/surface modelling)
  - [Engineering analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_analysis) (static; dynamic; electro-magnetic; thermal, using the [finite element method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method); and fluid, using the [finite volume method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_volume_method)).
  - [Manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing) finished design by using included machining modules.
  NX is a direct competitor to [CATIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CATIA), [Creo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTC_Creo_Elements/Pro), [Autodesk Inventor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_Inventor), and [SolidWorks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SolidWorks).
- AutoDesk **AutoCAD**
  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD)
  **AutoCAD** is a [commercial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_software) [computer-aided design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design) (CAD) and [drafting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_drawing) software application. Developed and marketed by [Autodesk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD#cite_note-Lendio-1) AutoCAD was first released in December 1982 as a desktop app running on [microcomputers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcomputer) with internal [graphics controllers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_controller).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD#cite_note-2) Before AutoCAD was introduced, most commercial CAD programs ran on [mainframe computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer) or [minicomputers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicomputer), with each CAD operator (user) working at a separate [graphics terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_terminal).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD#cite_note-3) Since 2010, AutoCAD was released as a [mobile-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app) and [web app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_app) as well, marketed as AutoCAD 360.
  AutoCAD is used across a wide range of industries, by architects, project managers, engineers, graphic designers, city planners and many other professionals. It was supported by 750 training centers worldwide in 1994.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD#cite_note-Lendio-1)
- Creo

  **PTC Creo**, formerly known as **Pro/ENGINEER** and **Wildfire**, is a [3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_modeling) [CAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design), [CAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_manufacturing), [CAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_engineering), and associative [solid modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_modelling) app. It is one of a suite of 10 collaborative applications that provide solid modelling, [assembly modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_modelling), [2D orthographic views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_drawing), [finite element analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_analysis), direct and [parametric modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_model), sub-divisional and [NURBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NURBS) [surface modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeform_surface_modelling), and [NC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_control) and [tooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool_management)functionality for [mechanical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering) designers. Creo Elements/[Parametric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTC_Creo) compete directly with [Solidworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SolidWorks), [CATIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CATIA), and [NX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_NX)/[Solid Edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_Edge). It was created by [Parametric Technology Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_Technology_Corporation) (PTC) and was the first of its kind to market.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTC_Creo_Elements/Pro#cite_note-1)
  The application runs on [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows). The [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX) version was discontinued after 4.0,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTC_Creo_Elements/Pro#cite_note-2) except [x86-64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64) UNIX on [Solaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(operating_system)).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTC_Creo_Elements/Pro#cite_note-3) The name changed to Creo 1.0 after Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire 5.0 (rebranded PTC Creo Elements/Pro),[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTC_Creo_Elements/Pro#cite_note-4) took place on October 28, 2010, which coincided with PTCâ€™s announcement of [Creo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creo_(design_software)), a new design software application suite.

  The product is sold specifically as [CAID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_industrial_design) rather than CAD, and its tools and abilities are oriented more towards the "styling" aspect of design - that is to say, the product's housing and outer appearance. It does not go into mechanical detail like other CAD programs such as [Siemens NX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_NX), [Inventor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_Inventor), [CATIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CATIA), [Pro/ENGINEER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProEngineer) and [SolidWorks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SolidWorks), but has a much more powerful set of tools for the creation of precisely sculpted curves and surfaces and all 'touch and feel' surfaces of any part that demands aesthetic finish.

  MoIâ€™s sleek intuitive UI blends a fluid easy workflow with powerful tools, making it the perfect choice for someone who has been frustrated with the complexity of existing CAD tools.
  MoI is also a fantastic complementary tool for a polygon-based artist since its CAD toolset and advanced boolean functions enable extremely rapid creation of mechanical or man-made type â€œhard surfaceâ€ models. The icing on the cake is MoIâ€™s unique polygon mesh export that generates exceptionally clean and crisp N-Gon polygon meshes from CAD NURBS models.

  industrial desgin is creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize :
  - function
  - value
  - appearance
  of products and systems for the mutual benefit of the user and manufacturer
  ```
  the concept starts with a sketch (either pen/pencil on paper or in a graphics application), which is then refined over time.  Following that, there's an evaluation of potential materials and methods, from both aesthetic and technical viewpoints, and then the product is laid out and tested in engineering-based CAD programs.

  housing seals
  gasket
  insert moulding
  over moulded elastomerics
  welding such as ultrasonic and hotplate welding
  double-sided foam tape and adhesives
  Gasket
  Sealant
  Optical Bonding
  Rules of Thumb :
  - A stretch greater than 5% on the O-ring I.D. is not recommended because it can lead to a loss of seal compression due to reduced cross-section.
  - A Groove Depth is the machined depth into one surface, whereas a Gland Depth consists of the Groove Depth plus clearance. The Gland Depth is used to calculate seal compression.
