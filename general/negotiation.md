negotiate everything

Trust that when the answer is no, there's a better yes down the road.

Get the other person's Point of view and see things from that person angle as well as from your own.

Align my self-interest with people self-interest.

Straight forward intentions. Love not hate.

Don't argue with a closed door. Look further and find an open one.

In this way, it’s sometimes the people with the highest opinion of themselves are often the ones with the lowest self-esteem.

So perhaps it’s no surprise that confidence is the foundation that [makes it okay to be vulnerable](https://www.themuse.com/advice/how-i-turned-vulnerability-into-career-success). It’s the layer of self-trust that allows you to take a few bricks out of that wall and know you’ll be okay, to really show up and to show others who you are.

Real, natural confidence is trust rather than second-guessing. It’s congruity rather than compartmentalization. It’s ease rather than resistance.
