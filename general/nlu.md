# Natural Language Understanding

> understand the intent of what the user is trying to say
> differentiate that when a user is saying “set an alarm for 7AM tomorrow,” the user is asking about setting an alarm and not about making a call.


This is challenging because different users speak the same sentence in different ways. For instance, one can say the same thing in the following ways:

Hey Siri, can you set me an alarm for 7AM tomorrow?
Siri, can you wake me up tomorrow at 7AM?
Siri, please set an alarm for tomorrow at 7AM.
Siri, please wake me up tomorrow at 7AM.

These are just a few right ways of telling Siri to set an alarm. Some people may speak grammatically incorrect sentences – “Siri alarm set me tomorrow at 7AM”. As a result, the intent analysis becomes very challenging. Just like speech recognition, intent analysis also requires a lot of data in order to train Natural Language Processing algorithms. Only when the dataset provided is huge is it the case that Siri is able to generalize and capture the variations of the same sentence that it has never seen. This makes the whole processes an extremely difficult task. In order to accomplish such mammoth tasks, Apple hires top-notch software engineers that have years of experience in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing.

These are just 2 of the most fundamental challenges. Another important technology behind Siri that employs Machine Learning is that of contextual understanding. You can talk to Siri like you are talking to a human:
You: Hey Siri, set an alarm.
Siri: What time do you want me to set an alarm?
You: 7 AM.

In the last sentence, when you said “7 AM”, Siri was able to understand and correlate that this 7 AM is a continuation of the last message where you asked it to set an alarm.

One final technology that Siri employs in this whole process is that of entity extraction. When you ask Siri to set an alarm for tomorrow at 7AM, Siri not only understands the meaning of your sentence, but also it automatically picks up entities from the sentence
