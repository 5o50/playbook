you have no friends. dont talk. find the intent.

**identify enemies:**

> An ally needs to see that the benefits of supporting you outweigh the benefits of going against you.

> an enemy is someone who provides a regular flow of negativity in your life through their words and actions. There’s no reason you should have to put up with that

> in the grand scheme of life, the more allies you have, the better.

And let’s not forget the office: your boss and colleagues are some of the most common enemies you’ll encounter.

> you sometimes have to look beyond their facade, and look at their actions toward you. ...our enemies dislike us, as we do them. They certainly don’t love us either, but may not express absolute hatred that can carry impulsivity, loss of control, and in the end, the tendency to invade boundaries, emotional or even physical. Enemies in other words, can still have maturity, boundaries, and even carry our respect in the presence of dislike.

They could be a friend of a friend that regularly disrespects you, a classmate that gossips about you behind your back, or even an in-law that just doesn’t seem to like you very much. 

They might refuse to give you projects for no reason, take credit for your ideas, or otherwise hold your career back.

Anyone who has cheated, bullied, betrayed, slandered, used, or consistently disrespected or criticized you can be considered an enemy.

Real enemies, they can hide in plain sight. You both may know that you dislike each other, but it’s likely that no one else is aware of your tension. An enemy may not even express things to you directly, so you might hear about their dislike through gossip, emails, text messages, and other means.

That doesn’t mean they have to be your friend: when it comes to your relationship, a friend isn’t looking at what’s in it for them, but an ally usually is.

You may never get all buddy-buddy with your adversaries (and may not want to), but that’s okay.

To get on your enemy’s good side, you have to stop playing the part of their enemy.

they do not know you. And if you continue to play the enemy, they never will.

it takes two sides to start a war

- **Use their name a lot**: According to Dale Carnegie, the author of *[How to Win Friends and Influence People](http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034?tag=lifehackeramzn-20&ascsubtag=95b1b580ba70c150982ff408851f4ca198b5c2dd)*, a person’s name is the sweetest sound they can ever hear. Say their name, and their title if applicable, whenever you speak or write to them. They’ll eat it up.
- **[Follow the “Platinum Rule”](http://lifehacker.com/be-more-likable-in-any-situation-by-following-the-plat-1714767371)**: The Golden Rule suggests you treat someone how you would want to be treated, but your enemy isn’t you. Instead, follow the Platinum Rule and treat them how they want to be treated. You’re not sucking up, you’re just appealing to their sensibilities.
- **[Make them feel like an expert](http://lifehacker.com/be-more-likable-in-conversation-by-making-the-other-per-1723226851)**: People want to feel intelligent and capable, so make your enemy feel like that and you’ll become a source of confidence in their life. Ask them for help with something you already know how to do; ask for their opinion on certain topics, even if you don’t care to hear it; and point out how knowledgeable they are on topics that interest them.
- **[Practice Mirroring](http://lifehacker.com/how-to-develop-your-charisma-and-become-more-likable-1673988208#_ga=1.35835552.1667622160.1441735094)**: You don’t want to be a copycat, but people tend to like those that match up with their own energy level and mannerisms. If they get excited about something, you get excited about something. If they like to use their hands when they talk, get your arms moving.
- **Find (or create) common interests**: People like others who have something in common with them. Do your homework and find something to connect you both. Hobbies, sports teams, food, travel, books, and even politics can all be great places to find common ground. If nothing seems to line up, and you’re feeling dastardly, find something they like and latch on. Just be sure to pick something you can actually talk about and doesn’t require a ton of knowledge.
- **Avoid arguments and let them be right**: They might make your blood boil, but avoid arguments at all costs. If you feel one coming on, try to back out. If you can’t, let them talk first about their point of view and say, “Interesting, I never thought about it like that before.” That simple phrase does three things: it makes them feel like their perspective is interesting (even if it isn’t), it makes them feel like they may have persuaded you in some way (oooh power), and it ends the discussion because they’ve made their peace.
- **Repeat back what they say**: When they say something that seems important, repeat it back to them. For example, if they say “it’s better to have meetings on Wednesday”, you’d say “I see, so it is actually better to have meetings in the middle of the week.” A recent study, [published in the *American Journal of Psychotherapy*](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17760322), suggests that repeating things back makes others feel heard, and shows that you value their opinion.

dont put bad people out of your life — master them with no control - deceit.

insecure people are sneaky
