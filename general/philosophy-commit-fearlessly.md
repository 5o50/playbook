Courage- commit and surrender fearlessly
===

If you don't know you can still:

WALK FAST FEARLESSLY LIKE A FOOL — YOU'LL BE WISER SOONER AT YOUR OWN RISK :D

Freedom is the ability to set your schedule, to decide on the work you do, to make decisions. **Responsibility is being held accountable for your actions.**

be super responsive to your team and the outside world

always be clear on the strategy and priorities

**BE PRESENT & POSITIVE**

**je sais ce que je veux (intuition)**

**TRUST YOUR GUTS**

toutes les réponses sont à l'intérieur de toi

calm et ecoutes ton intuition

**know your own worth**

YOU ARE THE COSMOS — NATURE — SOLEIL — CALM — INFINITÉ — SERENITÉ

**i don’t care who I loose anymore, I got shit to do, world is abundant**

**don't waste time with energy takers, go with energy givers**

**FOCUS**

**add constraints — it gives you power**

**power of constraints**

**Le temps et resources sont limités, il faut être précis et ecologique !**

**PRIORITIZE**

**Prioritization is critical and hard**.

(Equally important to setting the company’s priorities is setting your own tactical priorities. What I’ve found works best for me personally is a pen-and-paper list for each day with ~3 major tasks and ~30 minor ones, and an annual to-do list of overall goals.)

**PLAN & ASK FEW, BUT RIGHT QUESTIONS**

**Be clear and methodical**

Many people who are energetic about execution tend to jump into activities and take action before they get organized, create a plan, or connect what they’re doing to the strategy of the organization. **Having the discipline to organize people, assemble resources, and then generate a plan that others can commit to** will collectively improve execution. So will **making clear who is doing what**; we have learned that **when everyone is collectively responsible, that no one is responsible**. Providing others with clear direction and a **sense of connection to the strategy of the organization helps people understand how the work they are doing dovetails** with the organization’s mission.

If you are quick to jump into action and tend to start project without a well-organized plan of attack, or if you get feedback on your lack of planning and organization, this suggestion might be one to focus on. An individual contributor might be able to get away with being disorganized, but it rarely works out well at the senior management level.

**TAKE DECISIONS FIRST (when others are blocked) (JUST, CLEAR, LIMITED,REASONED —> IDENTITY UNITY)**

HONOR THE PRESENT

IL VAUT MIEUX PRENDRE UNE DECISION QUE DE NE PAS EN PRENDRE.

**TAKE DECISIONS FIRST — PROPOSE THE RIGHT THING FIRST**

peu importe la decision c'est pas si important

mais si tu n'en prend pas les autres en prennent pour toi et te détourne de ton chemin

**Set stretch goals and deadlines**

Setting stretch goals helps the group achieve their objectives and generates greater engagement and satisfaction in team members. To push the group to achieve those goals, pair them with deadlines. While we may not like it, when someone gives us a deadline, our behavior changes. Simply setting deadlines for goals and objectives goes a long way toward achieving those goals and objectives! If you resist setting stretch goals for your team, start by asking your team questions like, “What would it take to accomplished this goal two weeks earlier?” We find that by challenging your team and supporting them in accomplishing a difficult goal, team members actually feel more engaged and satisfied with their jobs.

But don’t go overboard; we’ve also found that too much pushing can erode trust, which will hurt execution in the long run. When an untrusted leader asks for additional effort, people question their motives and resist their requests. Moreover, involving your team in the process of setting goals deadlines will increase their sense of commitment and autonomy.

**EXECUTE QUICKLY**

**TRACK PROGRESS WITH IMPROVE W/ FEEDBACKS**

**Give more feedback, especially more positive feedback**

This is all about improving execution through intrinsic motivation, rather than through goals and deadlines. Leaders who are great executors are skilled at giving feedback. Specifically, the leaders who rate most highly are those who deliver critical feedback by taking the time to listen to and understand their employees’ perspectives, rather than simply dropping a difficult message on someone and ending the conversation as quickly as possible.

But where we really saw a major difference was with positive feedback. Specifically, we found that leaders who are great at execution give a lot more positive recognition. Our research indicates that while giving a little more recognition did not affect execution, being above the 65th percentile on this skill had a major impact.

**KNOW YOUR WEAKNESSES**

**REMOVE BUREAUCRACY**

**REPEAT QUICK UNSTOPPABLE**

Tu a l'arme encore, faut-il avoir le cran.

DO YOUR THING MAN, DONT ASK BEFORE

MENTAL D'ACIER. SERRE TA VIS AVEC TOI MEME POUR DE BON. STICK TO IT. VISION CLAIR. FRAME SOLIDE. YOUR VISION DOMINATE.

unstoppability, determination, formidability, and resourcefulness. Intelligence and passion also rank very highly

FOCUS ON YOUR **GOAL**, **GLOW** AND **GRIND**

This is as much about battle as about business

make sure the company wins

**“do whatever it takes” attitude to win your interests**

there will be plenty of unpleasant schleps. 

If the team sees you doing these things, they will do them too.

knowledge without authority is instruction

knowledge with authority is mastering

**If your company screw up, pickup the pieces, dont flee.**

Believe me, its worth more in the long run if you admit to being busted/admit to problems, refund everyone, close shop for a few months, and come back, than it is to exit scam and start under a new name. It builds confidence in the long run. Its easy to be honest when your business goes well. But its in the bad moments that you show your true face. If you've been fucked in the past, been honest with everyone then came back, it gives an assurance that the same will happen if there's a fuckup in the future. How many vendors look so perfect until they start having issues? and when they do, most will run with customers money. If you are honest with customers despite problems, it will reward you later. It also helps looking at yourself in the mirror in the morning knowing you haven't fucked over a ton of people with less wealth than you.

> THE FAMILIAR ROAD IS ONLY THE WHAT WAS; WE WANT TO TAKE THE BEST ROUTE; OUR GUIDANCE; OUR BEST FRIEND THAT TAKE US TO OUR DESTINATION

> the amazing power of simply setting a clear goal and attaching a prize to it. I remember how graduate students and professors on the MIT team became so engrossed in the DARPA Grand Challenge, **they forgot to eat and sleep. Humans can be incredibly dedicated and successful when we have a target in mind.**
