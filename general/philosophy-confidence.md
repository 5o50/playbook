ai confiance en tes convictions !

CONFIDENCE â€” TA UN GRAND COEUR TU PEUX TOUJOURS RESSAYER, REPRENDRE LE RISQUE, TU TE RELEVERAS TOUJOURS, THAT'S LIFE WITH A BIG HEART, ARRETE DE FUIR

It's not about not giving a fuck

It's about being confident in your ability to provide for yourself

You are the only person on the planet with the authority to fully and successfully validate your worth.

# External validation is like junk food. 

I've got enough fire in me to devour the world !

dont let people tell you that what you do does not matter -- dont give away your power, that should be the main message
