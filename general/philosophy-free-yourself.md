FREE YOURSELF
===

Sharing is freedom

when you keep it to yourself, you have to protect it so it owns you.

if you let it get your attention it will possess you and make you crazy. just focus on your breathing let it fall down 

If you suffer it is because of you, if you feel blissful it is because of you.
Nobody else is responsible - only you and you alone.
You are your hell and your heaven too.

DOULEUR ULTIMATELY DOESNT EXIST.

“As the mind, so the person; bondage or liberation are in your own mind.” If you feel bound, you are bound. If you feel liberated, you are liberated. Things outside neither bind nor liberate you; only your attitude toward them does that.

DONT KEEP NEGATIVE ENERGIES ANYWAY

don't swallow your sufferings; go through it find peace.

I AM LOVE & DELIVRANCE & HEAVEN — ECSTASE — SURRENDER TO JOY

LET GO
