Creating Good Ideas: Clear Thinking Is Clear Writing

i chose to be a master — I renounce people sympathy and give love without waiting for something

fil yourself with your energy and put out others negative energies

when disturbed meditate

your ego doesnt exist, you are the universe. and the universe is only what it is now

it's the universe watching itself.

on m'a dit très vite, t'as un grand coeur fait gaffe.

j'ai compris qu'un grand coeur peut contenir plus d'energie.

et que plutot que la garder cette energie, je devais l'utiliser pour donner de la force aux gens.

EMPOWER PEOPLE.

kundalini yoga

LIFE IS FORCE

PEOPLE GO TO POSITIVE FOR OR NEGATIVE FORCE.

ITS ONLY RELATED TO WHAT FREQUENCIES THEIR MIND WANT TO TUNE TO.

ITS RELATED TO THEIR UNHEALED PAINS.

FOR MY NEGATIVE FRIENDS:

CUT THE BULLSHIT

STOP THINKING AND DO, TRUST YOUR INTUITION YOU ALREADY KNOW EVERYTHING! POST ! TALK ! YOU ARE A FOOL TO NOT ACT.

when you smile your energy spreads — smile mindfully, it lift up your heart

be bon vivant

Personne d'humeur joviale qui apprécie les plaisirs de la vie.

make you day a little happier

Le bon vivant peut prendre son plaisir au sérieux : bonne nourriture, recherches des bonnes adresses, des spectacles de qualité, des jolies personnes de compagnie, etc.

il peut caractériser un fin amateur aussi bien qu'un vulgaire débauché.

> when transitioning, smile and get through it — actions follows your energy — go with the flow of good karma
