> WE BECOME WHAT WE ARE EXPOSED TO — THE MEDIA IS THE MASSAGE

MEDIUM IS EXTENSION OF MAN.

THE MEDIUM IS THE MESSAGE/MASSAGE.

THE CONTENT IS JUST THE CERISE - it changes nothing.

ALL MEDIA ARE EXTENSION OF SOME HUMAN FACULTIES — MENTAL OF PHYSICAL.

**"The medium is the message"** — "content of any medium is always another medium"

“We become what we behold. We shape our tools and then our tools shape us”

"We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us." Marshall McLuhan

"Introducing a new medium to society changes our outlooks, our attitudes, our feelings about how we relate to the world"

**These extensions of our senses begin to interact with our senses. These media become a massage. The new change in the environment creates a new balance among the senses. No sense operates in isolation. The full sensorium seeks fulfillment in almost every sense experience. And since there is a limited quantum of energy available for any sensory experience, the sense-ratio will differ for different media…**

He identified the light bulb as a clear demonstration of the concept of "the medium is the message". A light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has articles or a television has programs, yet it is a medium that has a social effect; that is, a light bulb enables people to create spaces during nighttime that would otherwise be enveloped by darkness. He describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan states that "a light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence."[

We shape technology that shapes us back.

**WE SHA TECHNOLOGY, THAT DESIGN US BACK.**

If we have been able to create unhealthy smartphones that made us alienated.

They should be a way of designing an electronic device that make us more human and happy.

**WHY WOULD YOU USE SOMETHING THAT YOU DONT WANT YOUR KIDS TO USE ?**

if we are able to design an electronic device that improve our kids, it will definitely improves us.

technology that makes us more human, not less

WHAT IS HUMANITY ?

COMPASSION : Sentiment de bienveillance, de compassion envers autrui.

**You know, if we understand one question rightly, all questions are answered.**

not accept things as they are, nor revolt against them

You must understand it, go into it, examine it, give your heart and your mind, with everything that you have, to find out a way of living differently. That depends on you, and not on someone else, because in this there is no teacher, no pupil; there is no leader; there is no guru; there is no Master, no Saviour. You yourself are the teacher and the pupil; you are the Master; you are the guru; you are the leader; you are everything. And to understand is to transform what is.

**it is only the action of will and assertiveness that needs to be changed at all**,

the only mischief in relationship is conflict

- between individuals
- within individuals

conflict is will and assertiveness. Living without such action does not mean that we live like vegetables. 

Conflict is our main concern. 

All the social maladies you mentioned are the projection of this conflict in the heart of each human being. 

The only possible change is a radical transformation of yourself in all your relationships, not in some vague future, but now.

how can I completely eradicate this conflict in myself ?

this contradiction, this resistance, this conditioning? 

I understand what you mean intellectually,

I can only change when I feel it passionately, and I don’t feel it passionately. 

It is merely an idea to me; I don’t see it with my heart. 

If I try to act on this intellectual understanding I am in conflict with another, deeper, part of myself.

If you really see this contradiction passionately, then that very perception is the revolution.

If you see in yourself this division between the mind and the heart, actually see it, not conceive of it theoretically, but see it, then the problem comes to an end.

A man who is passionate about the world and the necessity for change, must be :

- free from political activity, religious conformity and tradition
- free from the weight of time
- free from the burden of the past
- free from all the action of will: this is the new human being.

This only is the social, psychological, and even the political revolution.

We should not just bemoan and accept these issues as unfortunate consequences of progress,” Cain adds. “If we are serious about providing a ‘holistic’ approach to student development and wellness, we must consider the emerging issues regarding mobile digital technologies as a legitimate factor with regard to mental health.

**find out a way of living differently — without** conflict between human & machine & in human itself

end my inner frustration

end this inescapable battle between me and my smartphone / apps — companies

- free from political activity, religious conformity and tradition
- free from the weight of time
- free from the burden of the past
- free from all the action of will: this is the new human being.

For the “message” of any medium or technology is the change of scale or pace or pattern that it introduces into human affairs.

“the medium is the message” because it is the medium that shapes and controls the scale and form of human association and action.

Our conventional response to all media, namely that it is how they are used that counts, is the numb stance of the technological idiot. For the “content” of a medium is like the juicy piece of meat carried by the burglar to distract the watchdog of the mind.The effect of the medium is made strong and intense just because it is given another medium as “content.” The content of a movie is a novel or a play or an opera. The effect of the movie form is not related to its program content. The “content” of writing or print is speech, but the reader is almost entirely unaware either of print or of speech.

The effects of technology do not occur at the level of opinions or concepts, but alter sense ratios or patterns of perception steadily and without any resistance. The serious artist is the only person able to encounter technology with impunity, just because he is an expert aware of the changes in sense perception.

Print created individualism and nationalism in the sixteenth century. Program and “content” analysis offer no clues to the magic of these media or to their subliminal charge.

A hot medium is one that extends one single sense in “high definition.” High definition is the state of being well filled with data.

Hot media are, therefore, low in participation, and cool media are high in participation or completion by the audience.

I think one has to understand, not as a theory, not as a speculative, entertaining concept, but rather as an actual fact—that we are the world and the world is us. The world is each one of us; to feel that, to be really committed to it and to nothing else, brings about a feeling of great responsibility and an action that must not be fragmentary, but whole.

I think we are apt to forget that our society, the culture in which we live, which has conditioned us, is the result of human endeavour, conflict, human misery and suffering. Each one of us is that culture; the community is each one of us—we are not separate from it. To feel this, not as an intellectual idea or a concept, but to actually feel the reality of this, one has to go into the question of what is relationship; because our life, our existence, is based on relationship. Life is a movement in relationship. If we do not understand what is implied in relationship, we inevitably not only isolate ourselves, but create a society in which human beings are divided, not only nationally, religiously, but also in themselves and therefore they project what they are into the outer world.
