# INTUITION
# NO WRITING ENDLESSLY. NO ASKING. NO SEARCHING.

**je sais ce que je veux (intuition)**

**TRUST YOUR GUTS**

👁 LOOK AT RELATIONSHIPS NOT THINGS— FEEL THE MOVEMENT — THE ENERGY — EQUILIBIRUM OR CONFLICT

**LOOK AT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THINGS NOT THINGS THEMSELVES.**

**THAT'S WHERE THERE IS KNOWLEDGE AND SOLUTIONS**

plus tu t’observes et t’apprend a te connaitre, plus tu peux refleter fidelememt ce que tu es — equilibre

RESPIRE FACE A L'AGITATION EN TOI, EVACUE LES ONDES NEGATIVE AVANT D'AGIR

L'**introspection** (du latin « introspectus ») désigne l'activité mentale que l'on peut décrire métaphoriquement comme l'acte de « regarder à l'intérieur » de soi, par une forme d'attention portée à ses propres sensations ou états.

Here’s a secret that most people don’t learn until they’ve lived at least a few decades. Some people never learn it:

**You are the only person on the planet with the authority to fully and successfully validate your worth.**

External validation is like junk food. It feels good in the moment, but it’s not very nourishing.

Self-validation is a superfood.

Try to imagine how it would feel if those guys your girlfriend dated in the past had never existed. It might feel a lot like the times you two are
together, when they never cross your mind.

Maybe it feels even better.

Write down how this feels.

**What is it inside you that feels validated when you believe you have all her attention, past and present?**

Do you feel safe?

Do you feel attractive?

Do you feel powerful?

Do you feel like you’re finally good enough?

What positive things can you think about yourself that you can’t think when you remember her previous dates?

Take note of each one.

**Your mission is to learn to start validating these things for yourself.**

- Perhaps you’ll write lists of supporting evidence for why you think you are those things, no matter who’s around or who agrees.
- Maybe every time you catch yourself fixating on your girlfriend’s past, you’ll tell yourself that , , , or whatever. And every time you say these things, they short circuit your insecurities a little more.

    you are safe

    you are attractive

    you are good enough

- Or you’ll find hobbies you can do on your own that help you feel validated.
- Or you’ll invent a new way to validate yourself that I’ve never thought of. If so, please share it. The world needs it.

Well done, identifying that your current thought patterns concerning this
aren’t rational, and knowing that you want to change them. That shows
solid introspective power.

**Now use that introspective power to learn to validate yourself.**
