ACCEPTANCE
===

ACCEPT EMBRACE WHAT GOD TELL YOU / PUT ON YOUR PATH ; GO WITH SMILE

THE ONLY REASON YOU DON'T TRUST YOURSELF 
— IT'S BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU ARE NOT CAPABLE.

ACCEPT YOURSELF AND TAKE THE RISK FOR YOURSELF AND YOU'LL BE YOUR BEST COMPANION. 

“In order to control myself I must first accept myself by going with and not against my nature.”
