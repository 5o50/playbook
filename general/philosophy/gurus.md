He is buried in the Rouen Cemetery, in Rouen, France, with the [epitaph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitaph), "D'ailleurs, c'est toujours les autres qui meurent" ("Besides, it's always the others who die"). Even in his death, Duchamp retained a sense of humor (a means for him of reaffirming his freedom, while undermining absolutes and certainties).

Steve Jobs

These were the last words of legendary Apple Visionary Steve Jobs, moments before he died...

I have come to the pinnacle of success in business.

In the eyes of others, my life has been the symbol of success.

However, apart from work, I have little joy. Finally, my wealth is simply a fact to which I am accustomed.

At this time, lying on the hospital bed and remembering all my life, I realize that all the accolades and riches of which I was once so proud, have become insignificant, with my imminent death.

In the dark, when I look at green lights, of the equipment for artificial respiration and feel the buzz of their mechanical sounds, I can feel the breath of my approaching death looming over me.

Only now do I understand that once you accumulate enough money for the rest of your life, you have to pursue objectives that are not related to wealth.

It should be something more important:

For example, stories of love, art, dreams of my childhood.

No, stop pursuing wealth, it can only make a person into a twisted being, just like me.

God has made us one way, we can feel the love in the heart of each of us, and not illusions built by fame or money, like I made in my life, I cannot take them with me.

I can only take with me the memories that were strengthened by love.

This is the true wealth that will follow you; will accompany you, he will give strength and light to go ahead.

Love can travel thousands of miles and so life has no limits. Move to where you want to go. Strive to reach the goals you want to achieve. Everything is in your heart and in your hands.

What is the world's most expensive bed? The hospital bed.

You, if you have money, you can hire someone to drive your car, but you cannot hire someone to take your illness that is killing you.

Material things lost can be found. But one thing you can never find once you have lost it, is life.

Whatever stage of life where we are right now, at the end we will have to face the day when the curtain falls.

Please treasure your family love, love for your spouse, love for your friends...

Treat everyone well and stay friendly with your neighbors.

Moments after speaking these words, that he had asked to be written down, Steve Jobs, aged 56, passed away.

Bukowski

We are here to laugh at the odds and live our lives so well that Death will tremble to take us.

Some people never go crazy. What truly horrible lives they must lead.

I don't hate people. I just feel better when they aren't around.

To do a dull thing with style-now that's what I call art.

If you're losing your soul and you know it, then you've still got a soul left to lose.

Genius might be the ability to say a profound thing in a simple way.

Bad taste creates many more millionaires than good taste.
