### avec le temps et la devotion tout deviens clair

> when i look around i always learn something

> When you first start off trying to solve a problem, the first solutions you come up with are very complex, and most people stop there. But if you keep going, and live with the problem and peel more layers of the onion off, you can oftentimes arrive at some very elegant and simple solutions. Most people just don't put in the time or energy to get there. We believe that customers are smart, and want objects which are well thought through.

> “People often overestimate what they can accomplish in one year. But they greatly underestimate what could accomplish in five years.”

> I feel the future you unwraping before you. when you feel it you become patient

> We’re all on own unique path to self-realization. It’s a process. But if you keep walking, no matter how slow it appears sometimes, you will reach your destination. Then you can choose your next one and keep going toward it again, far stronger than you were before.

> Suffering is part of our training program for becoming wise. Use it at your advantage to always move.

> Si tu n’acceptes pas que les bons moments vont passer, tu vas en souffrir, si tu n’acceptes pas que les mauvais vont passé, tu risques d’en mourrir. Il faut considérer les hauts et les bas comme une opportunité d’apprendre quelque chose. C’est ainsi que l’on évolue. Pose toi la question, qu’es ce que je peux en tirer comme lesson. Es-ce l’essence même de cette experience. ?

**Movement** is the path our eyes follow when we look at a work of art, and it is generally very important to keep a viewer’s eyes engaged in the work. Without movement, artwork becomes stagnant. A few good strategies to evoke a sense of movement (among many others) are using diagonal lines, placing shapes so that the extend beyond the boundaries of the picture plane, and using changing values.

**Rhythm**: A continuance, a flow, or a feeling of movement achieved by the repetition of regulated visual information.

> WE OVERESTIME WHAT WE CAN DO IN A YEAR AND SO GREATLY UNDERESTIMATE WHAT WE CAN ACHIEVE IN 5 — LIFE IS EXPONENTIAL NOT LINEAR
