SOUL IS THE SUPREME OFFICER OF GOD

if you look closely inside yourself

you will realize that

you are not your body

you are not your mind

you are not even your heart

those are only the divine instruments of the musician within:

your soul

> RULE OF INFINITY: EVERYTHING IS THERE; THERE IS A PLACE. BUT WE CREATE A SCENARIO TO DISREGARD WHAT IS;

EVERYTHING IS EVERYWHERE ALWAYS

WHICH YOU WILL GIVE YOURSELF THE RIGHT; THE AUTHORITY TO LEAN TOWARD.

FRUSTRATION IS JUST A DEMONSTRATION THAT YOU ARE JUST IN THE MIDDLE

> I AM A MASTER

> FREE SOUL IS ALWAYS LIVING SOMEWHERE.

> stories of love, art, dreams of my childhood.

> your perspective

Dirty Dancing: A Lesson in Status

pure masculinity and graceful vulnerability.

> choosing vulnerability lies great strength

> Let’s see what we can unleash.

> deliver each line as if they were attempting to change or manipulate their level of status that they began to deliver credible performances.

> Every human interaction—every utterance, every smile, every text—involves one person elevating or lowering their level of dominance or submission with respect to the other. Johnstone calls this relative level of dominance and submission “status” and argues that all conversations act like a see-saw of status.

> discipline= your soul dominates your emotions, your mind and your body

> dont let agitation disturb you

> know what you desire, and have it

> it’s all about practice ! repeat a thousand times

**Pleasure prevents us to see death,**

**Fear prevents us to see LIFE.**

**ONLY WHEN YOUR REALIZE DEATH, YOU REALIZE LIFE.**

we are born with greater powers than we think. most of us never find out cuz the way is not obvious for the mind, but straight forward for the guts. no one will teach you how to differentiate fear from intuition cuz it gives you power in this world. our education is incomplete, our current science is late — neurosciences will find out everything and make it clear for the public, give it 20 years. 🌱

THERE IS NO GENIUS — WE ARE ALL.

YOU ARE NOT ALONE, WE ARE TOGETHER, FOREVER 🕊

YOU MAY SAY I'M A DREAMER, BUT I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE.

I HOPE SOMEDAY YOU'LL JOIN US

And the world will be as one

MOZART:

He seemed to get completely lost in the music. He was so focused, so absorbed, and so intent on learning – even at that incredibly young age!

super-human ability to focus, it was clear that young Wolfgang had another major advantage over his peers. He had an extraordinary passion for the music itself.

He loved listening, he loved playing, and he even loved practicing difficult pieces!

When he found a piece that challenged him, he would attempt to play it over and over until he was finally able to conquer it. He even loved to innovate on the music by taking a piece he had mastered and adding his own personal touch to it.

Neither a lofty degree of intelligence nor imagination nor both together go to the making of genius. Love, love, love, that is the soul of genius.

I pay no attention whatever to anybody's praise or blame. I simply follow **my own feelings**.

Music, even in situations of the greatest horror, should never be painful to the ear but should flatter and charm it, and thereby always remain music.

I thank my God for graciously granting me the opportunity of learning that death is the key which unlocks the door to our true happiness.

One must not make oneself cheap here - that is a cardinal point - or else one is done. Whoever is most impertinent has the best chance.

Beethoven

Only the pure in heart can make a good soup.

Music should strike fire from the heart of man, and bring tears from the eyes of woman.

Music is the mediator between the spiritual and the sensual life.

**DONT FEEL ATTACKED. NEVER ATTACK.SMILE. SILENTLY. EASILY.**

**Descends jusqu’à ta petite enfance.**

Prends conscience que, dans ton enfance, tu t’es placé entre papa et maman. Cela t’a obligé à développer des attitudes qui t’ont fait réagir (comportement) et qui ont été néfastes dans ta vie. Si tu ne t’étais pas placé entre les deux, tu n’aurais pas eu tous ces comportements qui ont causé tous tes problèmes.

Reconnais que c’est toi qui t’es placé dans cette situation. Tes parents étaient des adultes ; qui pouvait résoudre leurs problèmes eux-mêmes. Ils n’avaient qu’à prendre le contrôle sur eux, sur leur vie. Maintenant, tu peux te libérer et reprendre le contrôle sur ta vie.

Reconnais qu’il n’y a que l’événement qui appartient au deux, et que tu as traîné des sentiments qui ne t’appartenaient pas. Aujourd’hui, sens-tu le besoin de partager avec les autres ce qui t’est arrivé ? Chacun devra reprendre le contrôle de sa vie. Même si c’est arrivé depuis longtemps, le procédé est le même. L’important c’est d’effacer la rage, la honte, la culpabilité (quoi d’autre) qui vous habite et reprendre le contrôle de votre vie.

accept you, think/feel for yourself/ don’t let your family, friends play for you

**It was only a problem because you were looking at it the wrong way**

When you don't know what to do, sit & watch. 

watch anything happening without trying to change it or to force it to appear

**Know the difference between Ego and Higher Self.**

Your Ego is your lower animal nature. Its mantra is fear and survival. The Ego talks very loud and is hard to ignore. By contrast, your Higher Self is your wisdom, creativity and intuition. It is Universal creative consciousness channeled through you. The Higher Self speaks very quietly and can be difficult to hear. Listen closely to the Higher Self (and edge out the Ego). It will create a healthier, happier mind. Bottom line: listen more, react less.
