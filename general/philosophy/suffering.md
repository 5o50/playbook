what make you suffer

only ignorance make you suffer; if u knew you would not make a big deal of it...hahaha

Even when you're down look at what you must defeat and then get up & fight.


Maniac Screaming

We should make all spiritual talk
Simple today:

God is trying to sell you something,
But youd don't want to buy.
That is what you suffering is:
Your fantastic haggling,
Your maniac screaming over the price!
