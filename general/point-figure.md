Point and figure

Point and Figure [https://i.imgur.com/AQieWy6.png](https://i.imgur.com/AQieWy6.png) We are now in a column of 35 X's this year. This is a very long pole. Only 3/58 long poles have gone past 35 X's. A pull back to over 50% of our long pole would put us under 13,987. We are near the top of our range; Our range is between 10k-17k.

FIB Retracement. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/OBTK2GPJ/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/OBTK2GPJ/) Here is one for people interested in learning an excellent indicator. This is an excellent example of a FIB play.

This is a very bullish FIB set up, HOWEVER:

1. The long wick due to poor liquidity on coinbase calls the quality of the FIB retracement into question.
2. The volume profile node will provide resistance at the current level.

Let's take a look at other exchanges to validate Coinbase's bullish FIB set up.

Bitfinex: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ts9wfwCT/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ts9wfwCT/) We are just now entering the volume profile node and price near 62% FIB, for the first time. This will provide resistance that could push us down 6-10% (or more).

Bitmex Perps: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/y3x71c4o/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/y3x71c4o/) Again, we are approaching our 62% FIB and volume profile node for the first time. This will provide resistance that could push us down 6-10% (or more).

Because of the inconsistency between exchanges, I would normally lean towards us needing to retest the 50% and probably the 38% FIB before we can continue up. Traders who believe that we could go sub 10k will likely be shorting here; for example, Peter Brandt @PeterLBrandt put his target to short between here and 17k.

On the other hand, Coinbase leads most bullish price action. Today's movement will help Coinbase establish itself as the leading exchange if we go higher. As many traders stop using Bitfinex due to recent rumors, Coinbase/GDAX has become more and more popular, especially because it has ties to new institutional futures. We should put more weight on the technical analysis of Coinbase.

Here is a cheatsheet on FIBs: [https://i.imgur.com/svA54TA.png](https://i.imgur.com/svA54TA.png)

TLDR: [https://twitter.com/joyrider50/status/945892351796379648](https://twitter.com/joyrider50/status/945892351796379648) We are discovering right now if Coinbase is the new exchange to chart or Bitfinex still has the most relavent technical analysis for crypto trading. Coinbase bullish; other exchanges bearish… Which will win?
