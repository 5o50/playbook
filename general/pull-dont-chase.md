Don't chase people.
Be an example.
Attract them.
Work hard and be yourself.
The people who beling in your life will come and find you and stay.
Just do your thing.

DONT OVERCOMMUNICATE INTEREST TO THE GIRL YOUR REALLY LIKE

The difference between pursuing and being pursuied

THE MORE EFFORT YOU PUT IT
BEFORE YOU HAVE SEX WITH THE CHICK
THE MORE YOU’ll GET PUNISHED FOR THAT

When you pursue something you dont think about its flaws 
you think about how to get it 
kind of like you’re in an auction
You’re  not thinking about the flaws of this item
You’re thinking about all the other 5 guys that are betting one
And the loss your gonna feel if you dont get it right?
So most guys are pursuing this girl
It put the girl into « i know i can have this guy do i want him? »
When you’re in that position its like when someone tries to sell you something or some guy pitch you a fuckin idea
WHEN SOMEONE PITCH YOU SOMETHING THE FIRST THING YOU THINK ABOUT IS
« WHATS WRONG WITH THIS FUCKIN DEAL »
BUT
if you want to get involved in the deal
and the fucking round is closing
And 9 fuck of your best buddies just got in there
You’ll be a lot less worried about whats wrong with that fucking deal
You’ll be more worried about how the fuck to get in it
Because you ll trust that they did their fucking due diligence
This is pre-selection between man&woman
