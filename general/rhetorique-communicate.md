Make sure you communicate on the right Channel to get people going (Fb messenger different than whatsapp or instagram)

to better communicate with people

- get their attention
- add empathy and warmth about themselves
- be concise and calm
- listen, mirror questions, expose critically reformulate - let them uncover the intent/solution/flaw
- ask them politely to keep to one subject
- keep out of emotions/moral/prejugés/people
- only help them with what they ask

Most of us are ignorant about even the most basic emotional triggers:
- we set off in others.
- We end up in pointless fights
- dismiss good arguments because they go against our biases
- judge people based on stereotypes.

We don’t understand the effects of:
- cultural context
- family upbringing
- the current personal life situation of our discussion partner.

We rarely try to put ourselves in the other person’s position.

We don’t try to understand their reasoning if it goes against our worldview. 

We don’t want to challenge our biases or prejudices.
