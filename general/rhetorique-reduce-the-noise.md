STOP ADDING NOISE ! be quiet. LISTEN. ask questions. dont argue.
===

There is only one road to happiness –let this rule be at hand morning, noon, and night: stay detached from things that are not up to you.

The Stoic claim, in other words, is that our pleasures, griefs, desires and fears all involve three stages rather than two: not just an event and a reaction, but an event, then a judgment or opinion about it, and then a reaction (to the judgment or opinion). Our task is to notice the middle step, to understand its frequent irrationality, and to control it through the patient use of reason.

TO RECEIVE YOUR HAVE TO REDUCE THE NOISE, SHUT AND LISTEN.

don't think, there is a right time, when it come it's effortless

continue playing silently

no fears

REDUCE THE NOISE -DONT JUDGE — FALL FOR CLICHÉS et BANALITÉ

**MASTERING IS TALKING DIRECTLY, CLEARLY, CONCISELY, VIGOROUSLY WITH CURIOSITY, AUTHORITY WITHOUT JUDGEMENT, CLICHE, CONFLICT, WILL, ASSERTIVENESS**

We judge, without understanding

don't talk for nothing

See people has whole person not sum of small parts

Ne tombe pas dans les clichés, tord les clichés

Avoid the clichées

It’s banal

cliché is when We know what to expect

No surprise awaits us in the form of an unusual word, an oblique loo.

We stop reading.

Only way to avoid it is to care deeply about words !

Be precise ask how much the thing is the thing.

Don’t be swift, be original, be precise, be genuine.

"Not soe with "input" which was coined to describe the information that's fed to a computer. Our input is sought on every subject, from diets to philosophical discouse ("I'd like your input on whether God really exists").

I don't want to give somebody my input and get his feedback, though I'd glad to offer my ideas and hear what he thinks of them. Good usage, to me, consists of using good words if they already ecist — as they almost always do — to express myself clearly and simply to someone else. You might say it's how I verbalize the interpersonal.

dont fall for cliché traps— dont jusge yourself: AI/crypto/privacy

Innovators, therefore, have two challenges: First, they have to unravel the status quo systematically. Second, they have to create a new status quo, where many players have adopted the innovation and believe they are better off because of it.

Remember that a killer app is an application so valuable to users that it justifies by itself buying the hardware upon which it runs. The original personal computer killer app was VisiCalc — the first spreadsheet.

To create momentum for a new product, the innovator must orchestrate changes in three core groups: 

- the players that add to the innovation’s benefits — COLLABORATORS
- the players that act as channels to adopters — INFLUENCERS
- the adopters themselves. — USERS

The innovator can do that by understanding how each participant’s choice constrains or enables the others. 

By aligning the players’ incentives to switch to the innovation, the challenger can make the adoption of the new product a matter of common interest. This will create a virtuous cycle. For instance, adopters will motivate complementors and channel partners by boosting their revenues, and that, in turn, will induce the complementors and channel partners to keep the innovation attractive and available.

There’s a difference between using reason as a system of checks and using it to go against what your intuition knows to be true.

LET GO OF YOUR OWN IMAGES, HISTORY, ORIGINS.

FREE YOURSELF. FREE YOUR MIND FROM WHAT HAS BEEN IMPOSED ON YOU.
