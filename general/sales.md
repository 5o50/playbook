Spam, you see, is in the eye of the beholder. If itâ€™s an unwanted invitation, well, itâ€™s spam. And if itâ€™s an invitation you didnâ€™t mean to send â€“ even if the app lets you â€œopt outâ€ â€“Â well, thatâ€™s spam, too.

**Price ?** High Sell AND High Price

    Apple builds products that people pay for, at 30% margins. (If your project can't meet those tough criteria, even as an idea, no resources are wasted on it)

    This is probably where they shout â€œthink differentâ€ the loudest. From colorful iMacâ€™s to iPods, iPhones, and iPads, no other company has changed the way products look, feel, work more than Apple. They are the complete opposite of a me-too company, not satisfied with small improvements, only leaps and bounds will do.

    If you compete on price youâ€™re no better than the rest. If their product is a bit â€˜shitâ€™, yoursâ€™ must be as well â€“ seeing as it costs the same. Apple enjoys one of the highest price points in the industry, to the envy of itâ€™s competitors, who all bang on about â€˜value for moneyâ€™. Only problem for them is that customers know â€œyou get what you pay forâ€.

    **Higher Pricing** â€“ customers expect to pay a realistically higher price, but consumers of Premium Brands still need to feel that they are [getting value and receiving a premium experience](http://www.microsoft.com/emea/presscentre/pressreleases/DemographicTargeting_040610.mspx). The higher the commercial load, the stronger the entertainment value must be. But price is not limited to just commercials; consider costs like the monetary investment or extra steps necessary to listen to your product on other platforms. Is the end experience worth the cost?

No one at the company would jump through those hoops â€“ it shouldn't expect customers to either.

beam app narrative	https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Beam-p-fUcLnG6YPggJPf6zAuhV3

Beam (p)

A deck is available here.

What is Beam?

Beam is a new breed of software. Not a browser. Not a note app.

It is a new way to experience the internet. A lifelong cognitive experience.

Vision

Todayâ€™s browsers are performing the same task they did in the 90â€™s: displaying web pages.

The browsers and search have become indistinguishable for most people. They framed our cognitive behavior to such an extent we donâ€™t even question it anymore.

In truth, these tools have reduced the human thinking process to a terminal-like approach. Sequentially typing in commands to get results is not how we think as humans. 

We make the world our own by investing it with meaning. What we have gradually lost with browsers is the pleasure we derive from autonomously making sense of things and the ability to make use of our history.

It is time to build a tool aligned with our human nature.

Mission

Make sense of the world with everything you know.

Opportunity

The advent of the internet promised to bring all the world's knowledge at our fingertips, and it delivered. However, organizing the world information is not helping anyone put their puzzle pieces together in the long run. The times when Search seemed magical are gone. It feels cramped and clumsy, cold and impersonal. 

Once you start considering Search as an API, providing cognitive continuity, consistency and reflectivity to people through their lifetime seems like a logical next step. 

Information is great. Knowledge is better. Bits and pieces never tell the whole story. And behind the story lies emotion which has remained the missing element of our tech revolution.

The opportunity here is to stand on the shoulders of giant and transition from cold, impersonal data to contextualized, human-oriented information.

Problem

No tool is helping me think, grow and build upon what I learned.

Browsers are obsolete.

They know everything about you. Yet insist on pretending you're a stranger. You always feel you are:

- starting from scratch

- losing half of what youâ€™ve searched for

- stuck in an infinite loop of doing the same things over and over again

- not getting as far or as deep as you could

They have a very low input/output ratio, break up your mental flow, discourage follow-through and deprive you of meaning. You are imprisoned in a short forever.

These shortcomings create a compulsion to archive. Bookmarks and a variety of applications try to fill the gap - Keep, Evernote, Notion, Pocket, Pinterestâ€¦ Unfortunately, they effectively scatter thoughts in dead silos and end up hindering a healthy thought process.

No matter the technique, it consistently fails because itâ€™s an afterthought - literally after the act of thinking. Elaboration can only happen when tightly woven into the process of thinking, in the same media.

Factor in the constant erosion of search results relevance by aggressive SEO and you soon have people trapped in the illusion of a one-layer deep culture (50% of zero click search). 

Solution

Beam is the tool your child uses for his presentation on volcanoes in 4th grade.

For grown ups, itâ€™s the missing link between Chrome and Neuralink.

Beam:

builds and structures a rich editable history on the fly - a note card

lets you enrich it with your personal notes - like a classic note app

surfaces it in a timely and meaningful manner - whenever you search something similar

allows for collaborative search - build and share cards 

Knowing what youâ€™ve done is great. How youâ€™ve done it is a game changer. Like in quantum mechanics, mere observation alters the state of the subject. 

By putting you in a position of reflectivity and allowing you to amend your behavior, it is more powerful than any suggestion algorithm. You are the person broadening your own horizon in autonomy. 

Taking care of the dirty work behind the curtains, Beam gives you peace of mind. It relieves the cognitive strain and unleash your inquisitiveness at full power. 

Freeing you from keeping track of things, it gets you back into a rich organic thought process. 

At scale, Beam can become a search engine of its own based on the learnings of its users behaviors and their cards.

Why now?

3 major trends suggest the timing for Beam is right.

Anti-mnemonic blip culture

In the words of Frederic Jameson, internet technologies, from browsers to Instagram, have been fostering an anti-mnemonic blip culture. 

We seem to be stuck in a short forever aggressively hijacking human agency.

Douglas Rushkoff refers to this state as digiphrenia: a disordered condition of mental activity. Nicholas Carr calls it the shallows, describing it as a change in pattern of attention that â€˜s hindering deep processing and rich critical thinking.

â€œIt doesnâ€™t feel like we have freely chosen our online practices, instead they are habits we have helplessly picked up. That history has enforced upon us, that we are not distributing our attention as we wantâ€

From process to emotions

From Whatâ€™s app to Muze, from Facebook to Snap, from rss to feeds, and stories to more protean mediums, emotions are back.

As humans, we are constantly honing our tools to reflect our own nature. 

With the first coming of the web, tools we built were machine-like and cold. We now have the technical means to reflect ourselves better in these technologies, with all our human traits.

Beam will favor emotion over accuracy.

A beam card doesnâ€™t need to be perfectly accurate to be valuable. It needs to be honest, understandable and actionable. Human.

Privacy 

The privacy controversy is over. The failure of the Brave browser is a clear sign that people are not worried about privacy anymore. Lawmakers and GDPR, client-side data processing and anonymous sign-in Ã  la Apple are moving the right way. People are taking notice and are more than willing to share their data if the trade looks fair i.e getting valuable and actionable outputs. 

Beam sits on the good side of history, doing all the magic client side.

Additional note:

Sundar Pichai became CEO of Google thanks to the massive amount of data Chrome collects and because it secures the sales of Search. I worked at Chrome when it overtook Search internally in terms of data collection eventually allowing Sundar to take over.

Most of Googleâ€™s strength relies almost exclusively on a retail strategy based on Chrome distributing the Search product. It crumbles when they lose control of the browser because selling Search is very costly when you donâ€™t control distribution. 

The $12 billions Google paid Apple in 2019 for defaulting to Google Search in Safari (which owns 17% of the browser market) is a good hint of this structural weakness.

WHAT CANNOT CHANGE THROUGH THE PROCESS !!

What do you want to accomplish? (Keep it to 1-3 sentences)

What impact will it have on your company, employees, customers, and community?

How can you make it inspiring, fun, and creative? It can and should be a reflection of you.

VALUES

Values represent the principles or beliefs that are most important as you pursue your vision. Companies use their values to make clear decisions to support their vision. They can include words like â€œtrust,â€ â€œcustomer success,â€ and â€œinnovationâ€.

For example: Johnson & Johnson has an unwavering value of customer safety. In 1982, during a tampering crisis, it pulled Tylenol off retailersâ€™ shelves, costing the company $100 million. A costly move, but one that symbolized their steadfast commitment to their business values.

When writing about your values, consider:

Which three values are most important as you pursue your vision?

How can you describe those values so that everyone is clear on what it means to live them?

How will these values guide your everyday decisions and tradeoffs?

  Customer Endorsement

  Their main user base of Apple products has traditionally been the creative industry, usually known to be designers and media people. 

  This endorsement has helped Apple enormously in selling the â€˜creativeâ€™ lifestyle as it helps customers imagine cool and trendy creative people, sipping cappuccinos, tapping on swanky laptops and lounge in stylish offices.

   Another company which has managed the same level of customer endorsement is no doubt Harley-Davidson; with itâ€™s free-loving, no-nonsense, tattooed customers. Itâ€™s free advertising, just make sure those customers represent a desirable lifestyle.

COMMUNICATE CLEAR VISION
Effective communication patterns within successful organizations have three main characteristics: clarity, courtesy, and proactivity.
Clarity is a vital element in effective communication, because itâ€™s important for messages and information to be transferred in a transparent, clear, and concise manner. This is true regardless of where the messages com: managers to employees or within teams. Itâ€™s the clarity of these messages that allows them to be heard and processed by the receiver â€” and that makes clarity invaluable! Often, people donâ€™t communicate their messages clearly enough, because they are afraid of upsetting people. They may be afraid to say what they really want to say, or they dance around the actual message, hoping to get avoid saying what they actually want to say. In organizations where employees express themselves clearly and safely, teams work together better, and productivity is increased as a result.
Courtesy is another important aspect of communication, as it allows for messages to be transmitted within an atmosphere of safety and respect. It manifests respect for the other person and gets the message across within the safe limits of that respect. In this way, feedback, information, and messages can be transferred with minimal concern for getting hurt or hurting others.
Proactivity is a yet another crucial aspect of an effective communication pattern, because the only way to conduct a productive discussion is to conduct a proactive one. In real terms, this means that all parties in the discussion are forward looking rather than engaging with the past, which leads to blame and accusations. A forward-looking discussion is based on the notion that whatever happened has happened, and it canâ€™t be changed, so the discussion is more centered on what we can do from this point going forward in order to reach our goals or operate better as a team.

PRICE POINT	How phones went from $200 to $2,000 - The Verge
https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/18/18263584/why-phones-are-so-expensive-price-apple-samsung-google
Phones are more expensive than ever. Flagship devices from Apple, Samsung, Google, and other top manufacturers can now cost hundreds of dollars more than they did just a couple of years ago. Now, with the arrival of foldable phones, which are being priced at $2,000 and above, it looks like the upper limit for phone prices is going to keep growing.
There are a few different reasons why phone prices have been skyrocketing over the past several years. The first is simple: itâ€™s just sticker shock. In the United States, flagship phones used to cost $200 as part of a mobile phone contract, while their real cost was hidden away in monthly fees. Now that those contracts are dead, phone prices are all stated outright. That explains why, several years ago, the iPhoneâ€™s price suddenly jumped up to $649. (Albeit, youâ€™re likely to pay that broken up into monthly chunks.)
But sticker shock isnâ€™t the whole story. Phone prices really have jumped another several hundred dollars. In 2016, for example, Samsung charged $670 for a brand-new Galaxy S7. This yearâ€™s Galaxy S10 starts at $900.
Thatâ€™s in large part because phones are getting harder to sell. Far more people own a smartphone today than just a few years ago, and people are holding on to their phones for longer (perhaps because theyâ€™re so good, or perhaps because those two-year contracts are dead). Thatâ€™s left smartphone makers with an option if they donâ€™t want to see their revenues fall: sell more phones or sell more expensive phones. Obviously, theyâ€™ve chosen the latter.
Weâ€™ve seen options for bigger screens and more storage push the price for flagship phones into the $1,500 range. Even the starting price for todayâ€™s flagships is closer to $1,000 than the $649 of just a few years ago.
But this isnâ€™t necessarily just a bunch of uncalled-for price hikes. For one, the cost to build a high-end phone is rising: the parts inside an iPhone 4 from 2010 added up to under $190; the parts inside last yearâ€™s iPhone XS Max came out to $390, according to IHS Markit. Some of the markup is also due to inflation. According to the Bureau of Labor Statisticsâ€™ online calculator, $649 in 2010 would be worth $750 today, which is very nearly the cost of an iPhone XR.
In many cases, these extra pricey phones are essentially alternate, higher-end models. Itâ€™s less that the iPhone now costs $999 and more that Apple now sells an even higher-end iPhone model. The same goes for Samsung: while the Galaxy S10 starts at $900, a cheaper model, the S10E, begins around $75, and you really donâ€™t miss out on much.
The downside of this trend is that, yes, youâ€™ll now have to spend more than you did just a few years ago to get the absolute best phone out there. But the upside is that the phone you buy is likely to be nicer, and youâ€™re likely to hold on to it for even longer. So unless youâ€™re still buying the best every two years, you might not end up spending all that much more.

- **Reducing consumer uncertainty**
    REDUCE CONSUMER UNCERTAINTY
    With a STRONG BRAND
    Branding strategy for HT products
    Dowling and Staelin framework of perceived risk â€”
    One of the hallmark characteristics that differentiates products in HT categories from other categories is uncertainty.
    The more uncertainty the more
    Consumer Risk Reduction Strategies
    To help cope with perceived risk, consumers will engage in risk reduction strategies.`Roselius (1971) identifies eleven methods of risk reduction.
    Namely, consumers will reduce risk by relying on:
    - endorsements
    - brand loyalty
    - brand image/familiarity
    - private testing
    - shopping
    - buying the most expensive product
    - word of mouth
    A well known brand is one of the most favored risk reduction strategies employed by consumers.
    Promise that outcomes resulting from q new product purchase will be consistent with what consumers have historically associated with the brand
    Brand is collateral for the quality of the new product
    HT product may involve features that are complex and prone to rapid change with q shorter product lifecycle.
    Consumers may require greater technical savvy in evaluation. The inherent uncertainty can lead to negative emotions of anxiety and fear and lead to avoidance of the innovation.
    Less innovative products require less change un use behavior by consumers. Suck innovations can be considered incremental qs they are adaptions or ogoing improvements to products or technologies within a working paradigmÃ’n the other hand, more innovative products can be radical in nature â€” discontinuous, zgenerqtiinql or breakthrough and often contain q substantially new technology. In short, getter levels of product innovativeness result in more uncertainty for consumers.
    As consumers innovativeness increases the need to rely on known brand decreases.
    The effect of consumer innovativeness on new product evaluation is greater for HT product carrying new (vs existing) brand names.
    For more innovative HT products, the effect of consumer innovativeness on new product evaluation is not greater for new (vs existing) brand names.
    Highly innovative individuals will evaluate more innovative HT products more favorably with existing (vs new) brands.

people purchase high technology products primarily for prestige (usage) rather than to satisfy particular needs, and perception of change (culture) affected the adoption process of highâ€technology.
Tell a story â€” As a movie â€” Focus on lifestyle not product
  sucite adoption with a story
  Sâ€™adresser a lâ€™inconscient Ã  l'emotion
  et non pas au conscient et a la raison
  Prendre une valeur ou un aspect qui donne de la qualitÃ© a ton produit et exagere dâ€™exigeance sur cette aspect.
  Tu rends vraiment le truc tel que, ya pas dâ€™erreur. Pas dâ€™ambiguitÃ©.
  Garde lâ€™ecrin dâ€™origine.
  People donâ€™t buy products because of what those products do, they buy products because of what they imagine they can doâ€Šwith them.â€
  People donâ€™t buy products. They buy better versions of themselves.
  
  Most ads will mention the products new features, performance, quality or price. Peer on the other hand barely mentions what the product does for you (functional-brand), instead itâ€™s all about what the product says about you (lifestyle-brand) â€“ who you are when using an Peer.
Landing Page & make the products touchable â€” immersive ads
Landing pages are a neglected but increasingly crucial brand wrapper â€“ a key initial impression and touchpoint for many new shoppers.
â€œWe have 6.2 million customers, we should have 6.2 million storefronts.â€

  We're predominantly visual creatures. (The visual area at the back of our brains comprises 30 percent of our cortex.) The wrappers in which things come not only powerfully affect what interests us but also how we react to the contents we find inside
Products images, videos, and descriptions.
DEMONSTRATION honestly and IMPRESSIVELY â€” like bruce lee
  express yourself honestly; have faith in yourself 
  a good martial artist, do not become tense but ready, ready for whatever may come â€” exploit opportunity
  when you opponent expend I contract, when he contract i expand. 
  WHEN THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY I DO NOT HIT â€” IT HITS ALL BY ITSELF
  DONT THINK FEEL
  TAKE ON THE BEST
  I WANT DONT WANT TO BEAT THE WORLDS CHAMPION, I WANT TO KILL THE WORLDS CHAMPION

Marketing Security
  SECURITY ISNT THE END GAME
  Those who think that that technology can be made â€˜unhackableâ€™, don't comprehend the overall challenges and likely don't understand what 'hacked' means.
  Trust is the currency of security. We all want our technology to be dependable, easy to use, and secure. It is important to understand both the benefits and risks as we embrace new features and capabilities. For product companies, there is a challenge to show how their wares are desirable and differentiated from others. However, marketing claims around security can potentially undermine customer confidence, enrage potential attackers, and be a source of embarrassment.
  
  The latestÂ 'unhackable' tech marketing claim, for a digital wallet no less, falls after just a week. Luckily, it was an ethical hacker who disclosed their findings and not a cybercriminal who would have concealed the capability until such time as they could victimize users for their financial gain. There are many lessons to be learned.
  Here are my top 4 tips for avoiding the pitfalls of overstating product security:
  I would venture a guess, that in the case above, the security technologists likely stated all known vulnerabilities were closed, which was interpreted by marketing or management as their product was bullet-proof, while the security risk expert group was likely ignored or never engaged. Risk intelligence professionals would have outlined the types of threats most motivated, the objectives they would pursue, the likely methods employed, and what resources it would take to break the fundamental chains of trust.
  Both disciplines, technical and intelligence, are needed when determining resistance, translating viewpoints, and comprehending risk. Donâ€™t rely solely on a technical vulnerability scan or code audit to determine risk, as it is simply one facet of a complex model and only provides a partial overall outlook.
  Rule #3:Â Never ignore how technology will be used, by whom, and what dependencies exist (network, supply chain, endpoint configuration, etc.). Anything is fair game, including the technology, processes, and people involved in the development, implementation, use, and sustaining support. Attackers don't follow your product manual rules. They will be creative in finding the easiest way to exploit your products, likely in ways you didnâ€™t consider.
  Rule #4: Be kind to the white-hat hackers (i.e. security researchers) as they will work with you to make your products better. Save your venom for the cybercriminals and black-hat hackers who are agreeable with making your customers, their victims.
  Moving forward
  Trust is key for adopting technology. As the saying goes: "Trust is earned in drips and lost in buckets". Choose your path, messages, and partners carefully.
  Rule #2:Â It is important to understand how secure and resistant to attack your product is, but it requires a comprehensive evaluation and expert opinions. Security technologists (engineers, architects, coders, etc.) have different perspectives than security risk experts (threats, intelligence, methods, likelihood & impact calculations, etc.). Both are needed to understand the whole picture.
  Rule #1:Â Never let marketing make promises (or guarantees) that products are "secure" "unbreakable" or 'unhackable" when talking about the security of products. These words are absolutes for a domain where it is not possible. If there is a security story to be told, be cautious, accurate, and specific. It is far too easy to self-sabotage customer trust by flagrantly throwing about promises that canâ€™t be kept or worse, quickly disproven. It makes confidence look like arrogance, deceit, or ignorance. To put this into rational terms of how momentously bad this is, I am not aware of any digital technology ever deployed into the real world for widespread use that is â€˜unbreakableâ€™. Do you really believe yours is the first? Donâ€™t let hubris be your downfall.
