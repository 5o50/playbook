FIND AN INCREDIBLE VALUE PROPOSITION IN A BIG MARKET WITH NON-LINEAR PHENOMENA (network effect - moore’s law)

Create the FOMO to users’ friends to spread the word to the world !

Be an optimistic that definite the future and do it ! They are still a lots of secrets to find

You can’t find secrets without looking for them.

If you think something hard is impossible, you’ll never even start trying to achieve it. Belief in secrets is an effective truth.

The actual truth is that there are many more secrets left to find, but they will yield only to relentless searchers.

when thinking about what kind of company to build, there are two distinct questions to ask: What secrets is nature not telling you? What secrets are people not telling you?

**The best place to look for secrets is where no one else is looking.**

are there any fields that matter but haven’t been standard- ized and institutionalized?

What about something like nutrition? Nutrition matters for everybody, but you can’t major in it at Harvard. Most top scientists go into other fields. Most of the big studies were done 30 or 40 years ago, and most are seriously flawed. The food pyr- amid that told us to eat low fat and enorm- ous amounts of grains was probably more a product of lobbying by Big Food than real science; its chief impact has been to aggrav- ate our obesity epidemic. There’s plenty more to learn: we know more about the physics of faraway stars than we know about human nutrition. It won’t be easy, but it’s not obviously impossible: exactly the kind of

field that could yield secrets.

**The best entrepreneurs know this: every great business is built around a secret that’s hidden from the outside.**

**A great company is a conspiracy to change the world; when you share your secret, the recipient becomes a fellow conspirator.**

**Thiel’s Law : a startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed.**

**IDEA : What valuable company is nobody building ? What important truth do very few people agree with you on ? Find a secret and exploit it ! it means monopolistic opportunity**

BE 10x BETTER THAN THE COMPETITION TO BE IN A MONOPOLISTIC SITUATION

- 10x better tech or 10x better integrated design or 10x better service to escape competition
- network effect: must start and work with small market and first users and work at scale
- economy of scale: A monopoly business gets stronger as it gets bigger. fixed cost
- branding: creating a strong brand is a powerful way to claim a monopoly

**Beginning with brand rather than substance is dangerous**. Ever since Marissa Mayer became CEO of Yahoo! in mid-2012, she has worked to revive the once-popular internet giant by making it cool again. In a single tweet, Yahoo! summarized Mayer’s plan as a chain reaction of “people then products then traffic then revenue.” The people are supposed to come for the cool- ness: Yahoo! demonstrated design awareness by overhauling its logo, it asserted youthful relevance by acquiring hot startups like Tumblr, and it has gained media attention for Mayer’s own star power. But the big question is what products Yahoo! will actu- ally create. When Steve Jobs returned to Apple, he didn’t just make Apple a cool place to work; he slashed product lines to focus on the handful of opportunities for 10x im- provements. **No technology company can be built on branding alone.**

**Start Small and Monopolize**

****The perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors. Any big market is a bad choice, and a big market already served by competing companies is even worse. This is why it’s always a red flag when entrepren- eurs talk about getting 1% of a $100 billion market. In practice, a large market will either lack a good starting point or it will be open to competition, so it’s hard to ever reach that 1%. And even if you do succeed in gaining a small foothold, you’ll have to be satisfied with keeping the lights on: cutthroat compet-

ition means your profits will be zero.

**Scaling Up**

The most successful companies make the core progression—to first dominate a specific niche and then scale to adjacent markets—a part of their founding narrative.

**Don’t disrupt**

As you craft a plan to expand to adjacent markets, don’t disrupt:

avoid competition as much as possible.

**PEOPLE**

Work over People

Do you want divine product or to be liked by people ?

Don’t hesitate to be harsh about peoples work

**FOCUS: focusing is about saying no**

Practice deep focus

What is the fundamental direction we are going in ? What makes sense and what doesn’t

Why are we talking about that ? This what we need to focus on

Sacrifitial no, say no even to phenomenal ideas. Just to be focus on what you are doing

Microcosmiquely they make sense, macrocosmiquely they make no sense

The result is that the total will be much better than the sum of its parts

The impact of Moore’s law is visible all around us. Today 3 billion people carry smartphones in their pockets: each one is more powerful than a room-sized supercomputer from the 1980s.

But given that most people judge their computing devices on the availability of capabilities and features, rather than processing speed, it may not feel like much of a slowdown to consumers.

For companies, the end of Moore’s law will be disguised by the shift to cloud computing.

Behind all this exchange of merchandise and personal services may be found an abundance of opportunity to accumulate richies. Here our freedom come to our aid. There is nothing to stop you or anyone from engaging in any portion of the effort necessary to carry on these businesses. Opportunities are already there. Step up to the front, select what you want, create your plan, put the plan into action, and follow through with persistance. Capitalustic society will do the rest.

Find an idea, mix it with emotions and faith

Boost your desire and use it to overcome giant obstacles. Give power to your ideas.

1. IQ isn't everything.
2. Money isn't everything.
3. Success is more a function of effort than ideas.
4. IQ does not equal vision, ambition, etc.
5. Different people have different priorities.
6. Luck, or the lack thereof.
7. An environment that doesn't bring out the best in them.
8. "Book smart" is too often confused with legitimate intelligence.
9. They know too much (i.e., fear of failure).
10. They are successful (on their own terms), you're just not smart enough to recognize it (based on your criteria).
- Having **guts**, taking risks, and the willingness to constantly expand out of your comfort zone. The willingness to make mistakes and fail and learn from it. Many smart people are restricting themselves by thinking too much about the risks and then not acting upon opportunities.
- Getting the **real financial education -** you typically can't learn this at school or university (most teachers and profs are poor) and neither from your parents (unless they are very rich) or from an advisor. Why would you take advice from a financial consultant at a bank. If he knew how to do it, he would not work there in the first place. You get the real stuff only from the right mentors (rich people) and people who teach this and eat their own dog food, e.g. Keith Cunningham, Robert Kiyosaki, Harv Eker.
- A positive **mindset about money**. Many poor (and smart) people think money is something bad, unethical, and that they have to be ashamed if they are rich. If you don't love money and don't think you are worthy of it you will not become rich because your subconsciousness will constantly sabotage you.
- Developing strong **social skills** like dealing with other people, negotiating, persuading, being a good networker. IQ is not EQ. And even intellectually knowing something does not mean you will automatically act accordingly.
- **Self discipline**, not looking for instant gratification, a continuous strive for personal mastery, improvement and lifelong learning, going the extra mile.
- Taking **action** vs. just theoritizing about things. Being hands-on and pragmatic. Many rich people are more Doers than Thinkers.
- Leveraging yourself through **other people's** time, money, and skills. There is a nice saying: If you are an entrepreneur and are the dumbest person at your company, than you have made a great job and hired the right people. Many smart people are reluctant to use leverage. They want to solve everything by themselves.

In disruptive tech, no one knows how big the market will be and how you will access it. You got to get out of the building and test your MVP. Don't trust what peoples say, concentrate on how people use it. There lies the opportunity of a true product/market fit.

**What are the layers of risk for a high-tech startup?**

It depends on the startup, but here are some of the common ones:

Founder risk — does the startup have the right founding team? A common founding team might include a great technologist, plus someone who can run the company, at least to start. Is the technologist really all that? Is the business person capable of running the company? Is the business person missing from the team altogether? Is it a business person or business people with no technologist, and therefore virtually unfundable?

Market risk — is there a market for the product (using the term product and service interchangeably)? Will anyone want it? Will they pay for it? How much will they pay? How do we know?

Competition risk — are there too many other startups already doing this? Is this startup suZciently diWerentiated from the other startups, and also diWerentiated from any large incum- bents?

Timing risk — is it too early? Is it too late?

Financing risk — aaer we invest in this round, how many addi- tional rounds of Xnancing will be required for the company to become proXtable, and what will the dollar total be? How certain are we about these estimates? How do we know?

Marketing risk — will this startup be able to cut through the noise? How much will marketing cost? Do the economics of cus- tomer acquisition — the cost to acquire a customer, and the rev- enue that customer will generate — work?

Distribution risk — does this startup need certain distribution partners to succeed? Will it be able to get them? How? (For example, this is a common problem with mobile startups that need deals with major mobile carriers to succeed.)

Technology risk — can the product be built? Does it involve rocket science — or an equivalent, like artiXcial intelligence or natural language processing? Are there fundamental breakthroughs that need to happen? If so, how certain are we that they will happen, or that this team will be able to make them?

Product risk — even assuming the product can in theory be built, can this team build it?

Hiring risk — what positions does the startup need to hire for in order to execute its plan? E.g. a startup planning to build a high- scale web service will need a VP of Operations — will the found- ing team be able to hire a good one?

Location risk — where is the startup located? Can it hire the right talent in that location? And will I as the VC need to drive more than 20 minutes in my Mercedes SLR McLaren to get there?

You know, when you stack up all these layers and look at the full onion, you realize it’s amazing that any venture investments ever get made.

What you need to do is take a hard-headed look at each of these risks — and any others that are speciXc to your startup and its category — and put yourself in the VC’s shoes: what could this startup do to minimize or eliminate enough of these risks to make the company fundable?

Then do those things.

This isn’t very much fun, since it will probably involve making signiXcant changes to your plan, but look on the bright side: it’s excellent practice for when your company ultimately goes pub- lic and has to Xle an S1 registration statement with the SEC, in which you have to itemize in huge detail every conceivable risk and bad thing that could ever possibly happen to you, up to and including global warming.

**Some ideas on reducing risk**

Founder risk — the tough one. If you’re the technologist on a founding team with a business person, you have to consider the possibility that the VCs don’t think the business person is strong enough to be the founding CEO. Or vice versa, maybe they think the technologist isn’t strong enough to build the product. You may have to swap out one or more founders, and/or add one or more founders.

I put this one right up front because it can be a huge issue and the odds of someone being honest with you about it in the spe- ciXc are not that high.

Market risk — you probably need to validate the market, at a practical level. Sometimes more detailed and analytical market research will solve the problem, but more oaen you actually need to go get some customers to demonstrate that the market exists. Preferably, paying customers. Or at least credible prospects who will talk to VCs to validate the market hypothesis.

Competition risk — is your diWerentiation really sharp enough?

Rethink this one from the ground up. Lots of startups do not have strong enough diWerentiation out of the gate, even aaer they get funded. If you don’t have a really solid idea as to how you’re dramatically diWerent from or advantaged over known and unknown competitors, you might not want to start a com- pany in the Xrst place.

Two additional points on competition risk that founders rou- tinely screw up in VC pitches:

Never, ever say that you have no competitors. That signals naivete. Great markets draw competitors, and so if you really have no competition, you must not be in a great market. Even if you really believe you have no competitors, create a compet- itive landscape slide with adjacent companies in related market segments and be ready to talk crisply about how you are like and unlike those adjacent companies.

And never, ever say your market projections indicate you’re going to be hugely successful if you get only 2% of your (extremely large) market. That also signals naivete. If you’re going aaer 2% of a large market, that means the presumably larger companies that are going to take the other 98% are going to kill you. You have to have a theory for how you’re going to get a signiXcantly higher market share than 2%. (I pick 2% because that’s the cliche, but if you’re a VC, you’ve probably heard some- one use it.)

Timing risk — the only thing to do here is to make more progress, and demonstrate that you’re not too early or too late. Getting customers in the bag is the most valuable thing you can do on this one.

Financing risk — rethink very carefully how much money you will need to raise aaer this round of Xnancing, and try to change the plan in plausible ways to require less money. For example, only serve Cristal at your launch party, and not Remy Martin “Black Pearl” Louis XIII cognac.

Marketing risk — Xrst, make sure your diWerentiation is super- sharp, because without that, you probably won’t be able to stand out from the noise.

Then, model out your customer acquisition economics in detail and make sure that you can show how you’ll get more revenue from a customer than it will cost in sales and marketing expense to acquire that customer. This is a common problem for star- tups pursuing the small business market, for example.

If it turns out you need a lot of money in absolute terms for marketing, look for alternate approaches — perhaps guerilla marketing, or some form of virality.

Distribution risk — this is a very tough one — if your plan has distribution risk, which is to say you need a key distribution partner to make it work, personally I’d recommend shelving the plan and doing something else. Otherwise, you may need to go get the distribution deal before you can raise money, which is almost impossible.

Technology risk — there’s only one way around this, which is to build the product, or at least get it to beta, and then raise money.

Product risk — same answer — build it.

Hiring risk — the best way to address this is to Xgure out which position/positions the VCs are worried about, and add it/them to the founding team. This will mean additional dilution for you, but it’s probably the only way to solve the problem.

Location risk — this is the one you’re really not going to like. If you’re not in a major center of entrepreneurialism and you’re having trouble raising money, you probably need to move. There’s a reason why most Xlms get made in Los Angeles, and there’s a reason most venture-backed US tech startups happen in Silicon Valley and handful of other places — that’s where the money is. You can start a company wherever you want, but you may not be able to get it funded there.

You’ll notice that a lot of what you may need to do is kick the ball further down the road — make more progress against your plan before you raise venture capital.

This obviously raises the issue of how you’re supposed to do that before you’ve raised money.

Try to raise angel money, or bootstrap oW of initial customers or consulting contracts, or work on it aaer hours while keeping your current job, or quit your job and live oW of credit cards for a while.

Lots of entrepreneurs have done these things and succeeded — and of course, many have failed.

Nobody said this would be easy.

The most valuable thing you can do is actually build your prod- uct. When in doubt, focus on that.

The next most valuable thing you can do is get customers — or, for a consumer Internet service, establish a pattern of page view growth.

The whole theory of venture capital is that VCs are investing in risk — another term for venture capital is “risk capital” — but the reality is that VCs will only take on so much risk, and the best thing you can do to optimize your chances of raising money is to take out risk.

Peel away at the onion.

Then, once you’ve done that, recraa the pitch around the new facts. Go do the pitches again. And repeat as necessary.

And to end on a happy note, remember that “yes” can turn into “no” at any point up until the cash hits your company’s bank account.

So keep your options open all the way to the end.
