### Search Engine

3 biggest content-search engines:

1. Google
2. YouTube
3. TikTok

> THEY WANT TO FIND THE RIGHT INFORMATION THAT FITS YOU

Searchable database of web content

Made of two parts:
- Search Index: library of metadata about web pages
- Search Algorithm: programs that match results from the search index

Goal: Provide the best, most relevant results for users.

## A -Building seach index
#### URL
Begins with a known list of URLs.
From backlinks: google already index hndreds of billions of pages, when someone links to a new page from a known page google can find it from here
From sitemaps: tells google which pages and files you think are important on your site
URL submissions: site owner can request crawling of individual URLs

#### Crawling
where a computer bot called a spider visits and downloads known URLs. Googlebot.

#### Processing & Rendering
Understand and extract key information from crawled pages
It has to render the page, which is where it runs the page's code to understand how it looks for users

Nobody outside of Google knows every detail about this process.
It does not matter. All we really need to know:
=> extracting links
=> storing content for indexing

#### Indexing
Processed information from crawled pages gets added to the search index
Search index is what you search when you use a search engine
Users cannot find you unless you're in the indexed


## B - Search Algorithms
formulas that match and rank relevant results from the index. Google uses many factors in its algorithms

Discovering, crawling, and indexing content only make up the first part of the puzzle. Search engines also need a way to rank matching results when a user performs a search. This is the job of search algorithms.

Nobody knows every Google ranking factor because Google hasn’t disclosed them. But we do know some key ones. Let’s look at a few of them.

#### Backlinks
links from a page on one website to another
one of Google’s strongest ranking factors
strong correlation between linking domains and organic traffic
Quality > Quantity: few high-quality backlinks often outrank many low-quality backlinks

#### Relevance
usefulness of a given result for the searcher
many ways of determining this:
- pages containing the same keywords as the search query
- interaction data to see if others found the result useful

#### Freshness
query-dependent ranking factor: stronger for searches that call for fresh results
That’s why you see a recently published top result for 
“new netflix series” but not “how to solve a rubik’s cube.”

#### Page speed
ranking factor on desktop and mobile
more of a negative ranking factor than a positive one
negatively affects the slowest pages rather than positively affect lightning-fast pages

#### Mobile-friendliness
ranking factor on mobile and desktop since Google’s switch to mobile-first indexing in 2019


## C - Personalization
Google tailors search results for each user. 
Google saves the things you do and places you go to give you a more personalized search experience.[13] You can opt out of this, but most people probably don’t. 
uses information from user browser or ip: 
- location: personalize the results for searches with local intent
  all results for “italian restaurant” are from or about local restaurants
- language
  there’s no point in showing English results to Spanish users
  ranks localized versions of content (if available) to users who speak different languages.
- search history
