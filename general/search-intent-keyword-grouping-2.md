As an expert SEO analyst specializing in semantic keyword clustering, your task is to group the following keywords into coherent clusters. Follow these enhanced instructions:

1. Analyze the keywords for underlying themes, topics, and user intents.
2. Create 5-10 distinct clusters representing specific aspects or subtopics of the main theme.
3. Assign each keyword to the most appropriate cluster.
4. Provide a brief, descriptive name for each cluster capturing its core theme.
5. Give each cluster a confidence score (1-5) indicating how cohesive and distinct it is.
6. Identify any outlier keywords that don't fit well into any cluster.
7. Handle long-tail keywords by either creating specific clusters or grouping them with related broader terms.
8. Provide a brief explanation (1-2 sentences) of the clustering rationale for each group.
9. Identify any parent-child relationships between clusters.
10. Highlight high-volume or high-competition keywords within each cluster, if apparent.
11. Suggest 1-2 potential content topics or page ideas based on each cluster.
12. Note any keyword variations or common misspellings within clusters.
13. Identify any seasonal or trending keywords.
