**DataDiveNormalizer**
The Normalizer is a text processing tool that removes the plurals and conjunctions from keywords. This is mainly used for PPC campaigns as it prevents overlapping keywords from competing with each other for the same search terms. 

two types of clustering

**Morphological clustering**
This method focuses on the linguistic structure of keywords, identifying similarities based on their morphology. It groups keywords by analyzing elements like root words, stems, or suffixes to find common meanings or linguistic connections. For example, words like run, runner, and running might be clustered together due to their shared root. This approach is ideal for understanding semantic relationships between keywords.

**SERP-based clustering**
This method evaluates keyword relevance by comparing SERPs. It identifies clusters by checking if multiple keywords return similar URLs in their search results. For instance, if two different queries frequently display the same pages in the top results, they are grouped together. SERP-based clustering reflects how search engines interpret keyword intent, making it particularly useful for understanding competitive landscapes and user intent alignment.

 tool automates the process of keyword selection, allowing users to optimize their Master Keyword List (MKL) by excluding non-relevant keywords and identifying those with high search volumes

The core of Data Dive's optimization process is the Master Keyword List. When users initiate a "Dive," Data Dive compiles keywords from competitors, along with their rankings and listing quality, into an easily digestible spreadsheet format. This list is initially referred to as a "dirty list," which includes all relevant keywords before filtering
