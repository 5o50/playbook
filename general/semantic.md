THE MYSTERY WORD GAME
the first 500 words, the beginning of the content is most important
it needs to answer the mystery word game exactly like WIKIPEDIA does it
NEWS ARTICLES are not doing a very good job

you have a good page, if you describe the topic without saying the topic
2, 3 times have the keyword and thats it, no more



TRY TO READ YOUR CONTENT WITHOUT THE KEYWORD
CAN WE STILL GUESS THE KEYWORD? 

If you speak of IronMan Hulk SpiderMan
Google is capable of guessing you're talking about Marvel

If you speak about british luxury car where the symbol is an animal
It can guess it's Jaguar, but be careful with "animal" entity here
it can be confused with "animal" entity when you speak of "car"
