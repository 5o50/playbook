Make content that's shareable.

why people share things ? 

there is only 3 core reasons.

1. is them saying: "you need to see this!"
    lifehacks, learning something new, tips, hot take someone you know agree with. 
    Most of TikTok content is like this.

2. they're saying: "you won't believe this!"
    mostly shock value or entertainment based content
    the OG of it all in the internet, the "charlie bite me" level youtube videos.
    just the extreme of you wont believe this is real.
    Most of TikTok content is like this.

3. "let's do this!"
    the obvious, these are experiences, these are products you might want to try.
    I think about driving foot traffic to local establishments.
    how restaurants say "this is the best restaurant in austin for 2024"
    "POV you're looking for a date night thats non-alcoholic"
    "let's do this, let's try!"
    Most of Instagram content is like this.

Ignite that light in the mind which lights the way for action.
