garde ton sang froid, 

quand tu t’enerves t’as perdu

quand tu te plein t’as perdu

quand t’insultes t’as perdu

quand tu crois que tu n’en ai pas capable, t’as perdu

You ask yourself, “why am I saying this? Is this for my benefit or theirs? Will this help or hurt the person? Is what I'm about to say going to create change or make things worse? Have I thought this through enough?”

Ask yourself these questions daily. You'll be shocked at how beautiful boundaries are when they are working for you.

Boundary-less people tend to say whatever they want, without regard for the other. They think they are “just being honest” but the real truth is they are saying hurtful things without clearly thinking through their impact.

The other extreme are people that are “walled off.” Or, too boundaried. Rigid, tight lipped, and don't speak up enough.
