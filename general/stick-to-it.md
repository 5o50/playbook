turning a trauma into a triumph

Notice where you are weak. It could be that you are weak or entitled with your finances, your work, or your marriage. Whatever the case, if you truly want to feel good about yourself and your situation in life, it will require work. Plain and simple.

Whining and complaining won’t get you anywhere.

Hard work will pay off, period.

I used to think that it was my adversary, that I was trying to lift that which does not want to be lifted. I was wrong. When the Iron doesn’t want to come off the mat, it’s the kindest thing it can do for you. If it flew up and went through the ceiling, it wouldn’t teach you anything. That’s the way the Iron talks to you. It tells you that the material you work with is that which you will come to resemble.

That which you work against will always work against you.

It wasn’t until my late twenties that I learned that by working out I had given myself a great gift. I learned that nothing good comes without work and a certain amount of pain. When I finish a set that leaves me shaking, I know more about myself. When something gets bad, I know it can’t be as bad as that workout.

I used to fight the pain, but recently this became clear to me: pain is not my enemy; it is my call to greatness. But when dealing with the Iron, one must be careful to interpret the pain correctly. Most injuries involving the Iron come from ego. I once spent a few weeks lifting weight that my body wasn’t ready for and spent a few months not picking up anything heavier than a fork. Try to lift what you’re not prepared to and the Iron will teach you a little lesson in restraint and self-control.

flowers of forgiving

stop being dramatic

Look, the truth: you’re the most incredible woman I met until now. You were given to me, I just had to take you and fly, be happy, everything was perfect. I failed miserably at acknowledging that. why did I rejected you like that in the first place? what if you had been more patient ? How can I trust you now ? How can you count on me now ? Look I don’t have the answers, but I feel like what we can create together is infinite and taste as good as the milks rivers of paradise. It only depends on us. There is not a thousand people on earth that can share art, dreams, sex, spirituality and love.

Let’s focus on what we share and empower us instead of what divide us and make us miserable.

There will always be a space for demons and fears to cry, explode, burn, rest and to ultimately heal. Don’t keep anything for yourself, talk to me bird. 

Regret cannot survive the illumination of NOW, forgiveness and gratitude.

Regret is NOT stronger than gratitude, unless we make it so.
