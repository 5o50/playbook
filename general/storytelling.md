Make a great cocktail

**Story brings Rationality and Feel into harmony.**

**Rationality** and **feel** meet and mix in a good story, but they also benefit from one another. 

- **Mind-matter loses its hardness when mixed with emotion**.
- **And feel, sometimes flimsy or overly indulgent, finds firmness and strength from reason.**

    - Intro

    - Climax
    - Solution
    - Conclusion

- KEEP THE ATTENTION FROM BEGINNING TO END

    STIMULATE : just enough information to stimulate interest and curiosity.

    conceal parts of what they see. Show enough that they can guess but not so much they know or are pretty certain.

    get specific benefits, without saying how

    Get them to think the benefits are within easy reach before they realize the real cost. Ask questions like 'Would you like to..?' or 'Imagine that...'

    When something is being uncovered, so we gradually discover more, we become anxious as we predict what it might be and wait to see if we are right. We have to keep paying attention as each moment of the reveal gives us more information which we can use to confirm or revise our [prediction](http://changingminds.org/explanations/needs/prediction.htm).This can be visual or simply words. There is a TV game where the camera starts very close and zooms slowly out while contestants have to name the object. Sales people use this as the give demonstrations and reveal benefits one at a time.Verbal reveals happen all the time, as while we are speaking, listeners are always predicting ahead. Careful use of words can make use of this dynamic process, structuring words and sentences to reveal in an ordered way, always leading the listener and making full use of curiosity.So show them things slowly. Pause to let them appreciate each good thing. Layer hints to increase excitement. Start with objects turned away or in a box. Use words like '...not only...' to let them know more is coming. Lead them on a journey of discovery.

    Unexpectedness: surprising, amazing

    Novelty: new, different, changed

    Different: odd, unusual, weird, strange

    Scarcity: special, secret

    Benefit: exciting, interesting, thrilling, helpful, useful

sets the values, mission, and agenda of an entire generation that is yet to come.

- La portée (est-ce qu’il atteint son public)
- la résonance (est-ce qu’il parle à son public, à sa réalité)
- la résolution (est-ce que l’objet appelle à agir?)
- la rétention institutionnelle (est-ce que les institutions le mettent en avant)
- la force rhétorique (est-ce que l’œuvre fait partie d’un genre mais s’en démarque également).

**Characters**

- put the character in a vulnerable position, and force to reveal them. because each request for information forces us to define them: I am this, I am not that.
- Fully commit to your story ! Play your characters fully.
- every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water
- If you were your character, in this situation, how would you feel? Honesty lends credibility to unbelievable situations.
- What are the stakes? Give us reason to root for the character. What happens if they don’t succeed? Stack the odds against.
- Coincidences to get characters into trouble are great; coincidences to get them out of it are cheating.
- You gotta identify with your situation/characters, can’t just write ‘cool’. What would make YOU act that way?
- You admire a character for trying more than for their successes.
- What is your character good at, comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them. Challenge them. How do they deal?
- Give your characters opinions. Passive/malleable might seem likable to you as you write, but it’s poison to the audience.
- Simplify. Focus. Combine characters. Hop over detours. You’ll feel like you’re losing valuable stuff but it sets you free.
- give the reader at least one character he or she can root for
- Characters and conversation go hand-in-hand. If you’re telling a story without any people and no dialogue your readers will likely doze off.

**Telling**

- setup, conflict, and resolution.
- Once upon a time there was ___. Every day, ___. One day ___. Because of that, ___. Because of that, ___. Until finally ___.
- Une histoire ce sont des péripéties qui s’organisent selon la perspective d’un dénouement
- si marquant c’est parce que les événements ne correspondent pas à ce que nous pouvons attendre.
- le vrai plaisir dans un récit, c’est le plaisir de nommer, dénommer et renommer
- connaître les stéréotypes de votre public et savoir vers quelle nouvelle image vous voulez les emmener.
- What’s the essence of your story? Choose a design and stick to it. Add blood an flesh. Most economical telling of it? If you know that, you can build out from there.
- Why must you tell THIS story? What’s the belief burning within you that your story feeds off of? That’s the heart of it.
- **connects to the conversation you’re having, you are on your way.**
- les récits sont plein de stéréotypes avec lesquels on peut jouer pour rendre une narration véritablement marquante.
- la narration, parfaitement au courant des stéréotypes de son genre, s’amuse à les prendre à contre-pied.
- Les stéréotypes sont nos habitudes, nos repères dans un récit
- compelling and engaging cinematic story
- relating to your audience
- use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted, Give Your Audience What Matters You gotta keep in mind what’s interesting to you as an audience, not what’s fun to do as a writer. They can be very different
- Circumstance, Curiosity, Characters, Conversations and Conflict
- get the obvious out of the way. Surprise yourself.Discount the 1st thing that comes to mind. And the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th –
- Engaged Through the Senses (VAKO: Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic, and Olfactory)
- Emotions make the audience irrational — Spark the emotional side of your audience’s brain
- write to please just one person that is listening
- Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; you’ve got to recognize it before you can use it.
- When you’re stuck, make a list of what WOULDN’T happen next. Lots of times the material to get you unstuck will show up.

**SETUP**

- Do not get into a story without having the attention of your audience.

    dont get attention with you story, get it before you start

    GRAB THE ATTENTION FIRST with short a preambule ! And call people by their name so they pay attention. and feel related

    LISTEN TO ME...

    LISTEN To me...

    HUGE ! HUGE !

    LET ME TELL YOU WHY THIS WAS HUGE JIM! TRUE STORY! TRUE STORY! ITS UNBELIEVEBALE

- The setup is key. It introduces the characters and provides the background to move the action forward.
- start as close to the end as possible — Start in the middle, where things are exciting. It’s much more interesting.” give your reader as much information as possible  as soon as possible — reader should  have complete understanding of what is going on, where and when — to think to finish the story themselves
- Trying for theme is important, but you won’t see what the story is actually about til you’re at the end of it. Now rewrite.
- Have a great first line that sets up the stakes and grabs attention
- “None of the facts and figures matter until you have some sort of emotional connection,”
- Use curiosity to leave the reader wanting more (this trick works in headlines too). If there is nothing to be curious about then why would the reader keep reading?
- Set the scene and give the vital information that will provide context

**CONFLICT**

- If there’s not any conflict then there’s not much of a story
- you don’t want to be the Luke Skywalker of your story, but instead be the Yoda: “You’re not the hero of your talk, your audience is.”
- Your message is in your mess.
- people want to hear about your failures. People don’t connect with your successes, they connect with your messes
- bring the audience along with you as you contemplate what transpires in your story, but remember, you are driving the story, and must know the final destination. Keep your hands on the wheel!
- What do you stand to gain or lose? Why is what happens in the story important to you?
- make them gripping and set up stakes
- every sentence must do one of two things — reveal character or advance the action
- be a sadist — make aweful things happen to your character so your reader may see what they are made of

**RESOLUTION**

- Finish your story, let go even if it’s not perfect. In an ideal world you have both, but move on. Do better next time.
- Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. Endings are hard, get yours working up front.
- A story without stakes is an essay and is best experienced on the page, not the stage.
- sets up the stakes and grabs attention
- THE road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom
- violence and bloodshed
- Pinteresque dialogue
- startling performances from actors
- mayhem
- surprising performance
- RESOLUTION

Character is HOW YOU REACT

LIFE IS : TU REAGIS COMMENT ?


START MOVEMENT NOT JUST STORIES

It’s time for a new metaphor

We have changed what counts as a computer, but not how people think about them.

Maybe this time, the technology world can start with the metaphor, making technological marvels accessible to all from day one.

**Stories that herald values**

Stories, histories, myths, legends, jokes

[https://www.inc.com/jim-schleckser/use-stories-and-symbols-to-build-a-powerful-culture.html](https://www.inc.com/jim-schleckser/use-stories-and-symbols-to-build-a-powerful-culture.html)

Culture is often embedded and transmitted through stories, whether they are deep and obviously intended as learning devices, or whether they appear more subtly, for example in humor and jokes.

A typical story includes a bad guy (often shady and unnamed) and a good guy (often the founder or a prototypical cultural member). There may also be an innocent. The story evolves in a classic format, with the bad guy being spotted and vanquished by the good guy, with the innocent being rescued and learning the greatness of the culture into the bargain.

Sometimes there stories are true. Sometimes nobody knows. Sometimes they are elaborations on a relatively simple truth. The power of the stories are in when and how they are told, and the effect they have on their recipients.

Stories are also powerful tool to use in reinforcing your company's culture, a topic that Dan and Chip Heath wrote about extensively in their book, Made to Stick. Stories become especially powerful when people remember and repeat them to others. The trick as CEO, therefore, is to find and tell the kind of stories that reinforce your culture, values, and rules of you want people to behave.

Find a simple story that reinforce you Promises to your customers

**Elon Musk**

reframed a private corporation as being sincerely essential to the survival of the species _and_ a collective metaphor for bravery, curiosity, and other human traits we all want to be connected to

So he has a “marketing strategy” and a bottom line (ironic! cynical! corporatist!) but it’s in service of a cause he believes in (sincerity! humanity! optimism!).”

**Narrative**

search for metanarrative(s) that would create more trust and better cooperation, in order to learn to play win-win games better and to be able to face the tremendous challenges human evolution is facing.

The search begins from admission of aporia, contemporary metamodern discourse openly admits that we don't know how to proceed and what to believe, in order to make world better place for ourselves, our children as well as other sentient beings. And at the same time there is strong suggestion and awareness that we can't proceed without some unifying metanarrative to (re)organize our cooperation on global level. And that a metanarrative aka founding myth could and perhaps also should be now a conscious, ethical choice we search and build consensus on through inclusive dialogue and attentive listening.

A self that goes on changing is a self that goes on living, as Virginia Woolf had stated. The same, however, goes for any brand, and especially for luxury brands, whose success is highly related to the connection they form with their customers (Kastanakis and Balabanis in J Bus Res 67(10):2147–2154, 2014). Consumers today demand ethical and socially responsible behavior from luxury brands (Carrigan et al. in J Mark Manage 29(11–12):1277–1307, 2013). Which underlying forces led to this shift of perception? Today’s consumer, termed as the meta-modern consumer, seeks to use brands as cultural resources in his/her attempt to build their ideal selves through consumption (Holt in J Consum Res 29(1):70–90, 2002). Brands are, thus, evaluated upon their ability to provide their customers with appropriate subjective intangible benefits to use for the construction of their identities. As a result, a fundamental part of the perception of an ideal self today is one oriented towards a more ethical and responsible consumption. However, which actions lead towards an ideal self? To thoroughly understand its elements, a chronological overview of the concept is crucial. A philosophical overview from Plato to Chomsky will be presented in this chapter, concerning how the concept of ideal self evolved through time to reach its current form. In the next part of the chapter the connection between ideal selves and ethical luxury will be examined. Can luxury brands provide their customers with socially-oriented benefits? Which activities are more efficient in that direction? Two problems emerge, according to relevant research (Torelli et al. in J Consum Res 38(5):948–963, 2012); luxury consumers do not care that much about ethical luxury and an oxymoron is formed between the selfish nature of luxury consumption and the non selfish nature of corporate social responsibility activities (Janssen et al. in J Bus Ethics 119(1):45–57, 2014). Can these two issues be solved? Luxury’s everlasting attachment to long term quality and craftsmanship can be a catalyst in that direction.
