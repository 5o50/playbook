It is important to expect nothing, to take every experience, including the negative ones, as merely steps on the path, and to proceed. Inspiration is God making contact with itself. It’s love for no reason, love without an object. just for existing

“You are loved just for being who you are, just for existing. You don’t have to do anything to earn it. Your shortcomings, your lack of self-esteem, physical perfection, or social and economic success – none of that matters. No one can take this love away from you, and it will always be here.”
