DO IT. DON'T ASK FOR PERMISSION OR ADVICES
===

Only take advice from people who have faced the beast. The moment you prove you’re capable of slaying a Hydra, everyone will have thoughts about who you are, what you’re capable of, and how you should do your job. You’ll hear an endless stream of commentary and advice from people who have never picked up a sword with intent. 

**Do It by yourself.**

Don't say it to people

do it now. stop thinking.

DONT ASK ADVICE; NOR PERMISSIONS; think for yourself
