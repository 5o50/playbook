# NoOS -- Virtual Assistant (Artificial Cognition) (Hybrid AGI Architecture at the Edge)

> Adaptation plays a vital role for all living organisms and systems. All of them are constantly changing their inner properties to better fit in the current environment.

> The prominent feature of systems with self-adjusting parameters is an ability to avoid chaos.

## Definition
> A cognitive system as a structure consisting of relationships and dependencies that is designed to maintain a homeostatic balance in the face of a dynamic environment.


_bring together symbolic, connectionist, and quantum models of computation._
**how do I build software-intensive systems that weave together those pieces?**


agent-based systems that use then blackboards to communicate opportunistically with components of themselves where they are themselves AI? We've been able to build social avatars, social robots, and social spaces using this particular approach.

> you get a particular statement for which you're trying to find the question. We break apart that question and we get a number of potential search results, then we make some hypotheses, which expands out into hundreds if not thousands of possible things. And then we start to build evidence against it. So this is in effect forward chaining and then the rest of it is a bit of backward chaining, in which we look for evidence that supports those hypotheses. So we start from one, grow to hundreds, to thousands, grow to potentially hundreds of thousands, and then reduce it through probabilities to the three top choices. And where is the AI in this? Happens to be in the components with inside it.


### [Moravec Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox)
if you look at the distribution of neurons in the human brain, far more of them are used for signal processing, the visual cortex, the hearing cortex, than there are the decision part of it.

**cognition assistant — the word ‘cognoscere’ which is to ‘get to know**
*critical for day-to-day life, governing our thoughts and actions.*

- ability to perceive and react, process and understand, store and retrieve information, make decisions and produce appropriate responses.
- constantly changing and adapting to new information
- input and storage of information and how that information is then used to guide your behavior
- acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses
- distill all this information down to its essentials (the sensory information we receive is vast and complicated)
- help us understand information about the world around us
- interact safely with our environment
- regulating our behavior across our lifespan
- underpinned by both genetic and environmental factors

- controls our thoughts and behavior


# physical architecture
working memory, inhibition, cognitive flexibility, psychomotor speed and sustained attention

- Our distinct cognitive functions arise because of processes occurring within certain parts of our brain, but only some of these, end up entering our conscious awareness.
- over 100 billion nerve cells, each of these can have up to 10,000 connections with other nerve cells called neurons
- regulated by discrete brain circuits which are underpinned by a number of neurotransmitter systems
- brain chemicals which play major roles in regulating cognitive processes; including:
  - dopamine
  - noradrenaline (norepinephrine)
  - serotonin
  - acetylcholine
  - glutamate
  - GABA

## Overview

#### STAGE 1 -- homeostasis (soul awakening)
maintain basic function at equilibrium

#### STAGE 2 -- Basic Input Output (open the eyes)
load
AI components (vision - perception)

#### STAGE 3 -- Build Knowledge Bases (awareness)
