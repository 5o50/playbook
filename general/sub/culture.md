Culture
===

_An organization and culture will often share beliefs and ways of understanding the world. This helps smooth communications and agreement, but can also become fatal blinkers that blind everyone to impending dangers._

The major elements of culture are symbols, language, norms, values, and artifacts.


- The way people live and what they believe
- plays the role of guide, guides our behaviour laying down norms and values
- **the world happening outside the company's walls**
- The picture is **more likely to be one that represents contradictory and confusing cultures battling for the soul of the organization as well as those of its employees**.
- **Culture is not about a clear, sharp image of corporate and individual identity but deals in the ambiguity of everyday existence in a world of complexand often only partially shared meaning.**
- individuals also were at least to some extent the creators of culture

**how it works ?**

- But meanings change because culture changes. It surrounds us at all times.
- Culture is learned. It is shared. It takes time to develop, is transmitted across generations, and is subject to change.
- Cultural differences contribute to the diversity in people's thinking and living styles.
- culture operates as if it were independent of individuals
- It is important to know the past that has shaped your present and is going to influence your future.
- **educate people.** CULTURE IS NOT INNATE. It is LEARNED ! To take pride in the culture you belong to and to respect its teachings, you must first know it.

**It takes years to from**

It is true that culture influences us, but it is also true that we influence culture. In fact, culture evolves over time and takes years to develop. It is not a set of rules made by one or more people and followed by generations. With passing time, a culture develops and even changes in the process.

**why culture ?**

- It's how we make deep and lasting meaning.
- Culture gives us an identity
- Culture is (brand) identity
- Culture is Organization soul
- Culture is must for our own survival
- Culture is where you find context and opportunities for engagement and business growth.

üè∫ **Artifacts**
===

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists)

Artifacts are the physical things that are found that have particular symbolism for a culture. They may even be endowed with mystical properties. The first products of a company. Prizes won in grueling challenges and so on are all artifacts.

Artifacts can also be more everyday objects, such as the bunch of flowers in reception. They main thing is that they have special meaning, at the very least for the people in the culture. There may well be stories told about them.

The purpose of artifacts are as reminders and triggers. When people in the culture see them, they think about their meaning and hence are reminded of their identity as a member of the culture, and, by association, of the rules of the culture.

Artifacts may also be used in specific rituals. Churches do this, of course. But so also do organizations.

The last element of culture is the¬†artifacts, or material objects, that constitute a society‚Äôs material culture. In the most simple societies, artifacts are largely limited to a few tools, the huts people live in, and the clothing they wear. One of the most important inventions in the evolution of society was the wheel.¬†[Figure 3.9 ‚ÄúPrimary Means of Moving Heavy Loads‚Äù](http://open.lib.umn.edu/sociology/chapter/3-2-the-elements-of-culture/#barkan-ch03_s02_s05_f01)¬†shows that very few of the societies in the SCCS use wheels to move heavy loads over land, while the majority use human power and about one-third use pack animals.

Although the wheel was a great invention, artifacts are much more numerous and complex in industrial societies. Because of technological advances during the past two decades, many such societies today may be said to have a¬†wireless¬†culture, as smartphones, netbooks and laptops, and GPS devices now dominate so much of modern life. The artifacts associated with this culture were unknown a generation ago. Technological development created these artifacts and new language to describe them and the functions they perform. Today‚Äôs wireless artifacts in turn help reinforce our own commitment to wireless technology as a way of life, if only because children are now growing up with them, often even before they can read and write.

The iPhone is just one of the many notable cultural artifacts in today‚Äôs wireless world. Technological development created these artifacts and new language to describe them and their functions‚Äîfor example, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an app for that!‚Äù

Sometimes people in one society may find it difficult to understand the artifacts that are an important part of another society‚Äôs culture. If a member of a tribal society who had never seen a cell phone, or who had never even used batteries or electricity, were somehow to visit the United States, she or he would obviously have no idea of what a cell phone was or of its importance in almost everything we do these days. Conversely, if we were to visit that person‚Äôs society, we might not appreciate the importance of some of its artifacts.

In this regard, consider once again India‚Äôs cows, discussed in the news article that began this chapter. As the article mentioned, people from India consider cows holy, and they let cows roam the streets of many cities. In a nation where hunger is so rampant, such cow worship is difficult to understand, at least to Americans, because a ready source of meat is being ignored.

Anthropologist Marvin Harris (1974) advanced a practical explanation for India‚Äôs cow worship. Millions of Indians are peasants who rely on their farms for their food and thus their existence. Oxen and water buffalo, not tractors, are the way they plow their fields. If their ox falls sick or dies, farmers may lose their farms. Because, as Harris observes, oxen are made by cows, it thus becomes essential to preserve cows at all costs. In India, cows also act as an essential source of fertilizer, to the tune of 700 million tons of manure annually, about half of which is used for fertilizer and the other half of which is used as fuel for cooking. Cow manure is also mixed with water and used as flooring material over dirt floors in Indian households. For all of these reasons, cow worship is not so puzzling after all, because it helps preserve animals that are very important for India‚Äôs economy and other aspects of its way of life.

According to anthropologist Marvin Harris, cows are worshipped in India because they are such an important part of India‚Äôs agricultural economy.

If Indians exalt cows, many Jews and Muslims feel the opposite about pigs: they refuse to eat any product made from pigs and so obey an injunction from the Old Testament of the Bible and from the Koran. Harris thinks this injunction existed because pig farming in ancient times would have threatened the ecology of the Middle East. Sheep and cattle eat primarily grass, while pigs eat foods that people eat, such as nuts, fruits, and especially grains. In another problem, pigs do not provide milk and are much more difficult to herd than sheep or cattle. Next, pigs do not thrive well in the hot, dry climate in which the people of the Old Testament and Koran lived. Finally, sheep and cattle were a source of food back then because beyond their own meat they provided milk, cheese, and manure, and cattle were also used for plowing. In contrast, pigs would have provided only their own meat. Because sheep and cattle were more ‚Äúversatile‚Äù in all of these ways, and because of the other problems pigs would have posed, it made sense for the eating of pork to be prohibited.

In contrast to Jews and Muslims, at least one society, the Maring of the mountains of New Guinea, is characterized by ‚Äúpig love.‚Äù Here pigs are held in the highest regard. The Maring sleep next to pigs, give them names and talk to them, feed them table scraps, and once or twice every generation have a mass pig sacrifice that is intended to ensure the future health and welfare of Maring society. Harris explains their love of pigs by noting that their climate is ideally suited to raising pigs, which are an important source of meat for the Maring. Because too many pigs would overrun the Maring, their periodic pig sacrifices help keep the pig population to manageable levels. Pig love thus makes as much sense for the Maring as pig hatred did for people in the time of the Old Testament and the Koran.

+ don‚Äôt mind originality but think artworks as objects constituted within networks, their meaning given by their position in relation to others and their use contemporary¬†elements

+ like DJs or programmers, ‚Äúdon't really 'create' anymore, they reorganize"

+ shuffling together the diverse elements of present-day culture, blithely conflating high and low ‚Äì if such terms can even be drawn anymore in the long tail of networked micropublics ‚Äì while poaching its as-found contents from the world.

+ reality increasingly dominates forms of cultural production

+ Video games are the dominant form of fiction today.

+ new realism in which art becomes a background to life

**Tips for boosting creativity**

If you‚Äôre trying to nourish your creative side, here are a few ways to get started:

**Read about and listen to the creative ideas of others.**¬†You might discover the seed of an idea you can grow, or set your own imagination free.

**Try something new.**¬†Take up a creative hobby, such as playing an instrument, drawing, or storytelling. A relaxing hobby can help your mind wander to new places.

**Look within.**¬†This can help you gain a deeper understanding of yourself and what makes you tick. Why do you gravitate toward certain activities and not others?

**Keep it fresh.**¬†Break your set patterns and go outside your comfort zone. Take a trip to a place you‚Äôve never been. Immerse yourself in another culture. Take a course in a subject you haven‚Äôt studied before.

According to legend, when Michelangelo was asked how he managed to carve David out of a block of stone, he replied, ‚ÄúI just cut away everything that doesn‚Äôt look like David.‚Äù
