My Brilliant Image

One day the sun admitted,
I am just a shadow.
I wish I could show you
The infinite Incandescence
That has cast my briliant image!
I wish I could show you,
When you are lonely or in darkness,
the Ashtonishing Light
Of your own Being!

BE GROUNDED

STRENGTHEN INTUITION

one must examine what is taking place, see what actually ‚Äúis‚Äù. Not what we should like to think it should be, or try to change our relationship to a future concept, but actually observe what it is now. In observing the fact, the truth, the actuality of it, there is a possibility of changing it. As we said the other day, when there is a possibility then there is great energy. What dissipates energy is the idea that it is not possible to change. So we must look at our relationship as it is actually now, every day; and in observing what it is, we shall discover how to bring about a change in that actuality. So we are describing what actually is, which is:

The crisis is not in the outer world, but in consciousness itself. And until we understand this crisis, not superficially, not according to some philosopher, but actually deeply understand it for ourselves by looking into it and examining it, we shall not be able to bring about a change.
