**1. START GOING TO HIGH END VENUES**

https://www.timeout.fr/paris/club/branches-hype

You need to get into the mindset of “high value” women and understand where they hang out, what kind of people they socialise with, so you can tap into that.

Why you need to frequent high end venues:

- **Tougher to get in** – Think of venues where there are rich guys, exclusive areas where you need to pay or know someone to get in. The harder it is to get in and the more exclusive the venue, the higher quality of women you will find in there. I promise you.
- **Normal bars and clubs don’t have supermodels** – The type of women we want (9’s and 10’s) don’t go to the normal mediocre clubs and bars, not because they are gold diggers but because they will stand out like a sore thumb. They will get hounded by hundreds of guys all night long, who are drunk and just trying their luck.

So to recap, get yourself in with the high end venues and there will be endless amounts of beautiful women there. Also a side note would be to make sure you dress for the occasion, [learn how to dress](https://www.puatraining.com/blog/how-to-fix-your-fashion) like a high value male without actually spending a ton of cash.

**2. APPROACH WOMEN IN THE DAYTIME AS WELL**

One of the best ways to attract beautiful women is to go out in the day and visit some areas that are known to have girls shopping, eating out and socialising.

Why you must approach women in the day:

- **There are more hot women around** – Hot women shop, they eat, they drink in the day with their friends and so you need to use this to your advantage. There are some stunning women that don’t go to bars or clubs at all, because they don’t like them. You wouldn’t meet these girls, if you didn’t approach in the day.
- **It’s easier to talk to them, no networking or calculation** – It’s SOOOO easy to talk to girls in the day. There isn’t a guest list to pass, no VIP table to get on, just walk up to them and open.
- **Can go on an instant date** – If you get along with her, you can seal the deal by taking her on an instant date either to a bar and then a club or maybe just for a coffee.
- **Find the hot spots** – There are areas in every major city that are known for hot women hanging around. You have to visit these places.
- **Set up social circle by inviting girls to the club that night** – If you’re smart, you should approach girls in the street before going to a club so that you rock up with a good looking crowd of girls… not only will you get straight in, but you’re social value will shoot through the roof (more on that later).

**3. TAKE ON NEW BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS**

If you don’t learn new patterns of behaviour, you will never try anything new… this will lead to no new experiences or hotter women in your life.

How to change your behaviour patterns:

- **Try new things** – Come on this is so obvious! You have to try new things, like going to high end venues, mingling with rich guys and stepping outside your normal way of behaving in social situations.
- **Push boundaries, feel more fear** – When you feel fearful, it means you’re doing something you’re unsure of. But it WILL help you grow as a person and boost your confidence. So always keep pushing boundaries and feeling scared, until you don’t feel scared anymore.

**4. APPROACH AND HOOK PROPERLY**

Approaching hot women and hooking them is crucial to the interaction. They are going to get a lot of attention from men, so you need to make sure that you stand out and make an impression.

How to hook her:

- **Approach her as if you already know her** – A recent psychological study showed that if someone approaches you as if they know you, you immediately feel warm towards them and drop any guard you may have had. This works with beautiful women too.
- **How would I approach a good friend of mine** – Before you go over to a girl, think to yourself “How would I approach this girl if she was a friend that I hadn’t seen in years”. Sounds strange but I can honestly say this was the BIGGEST game changer for me and helped me approach 2 to 3 girls a night with great success as opposed to 10 girls with no or limited success.
- **Change the approaching mindset** – Always remember to change your mindset and adapt. If your approach didn’t work 5 times in a row, change it up and try something new until it does work.

**5. ENGINEER SOCIAL VALUE**

In high end clubs, you need to engineer your social value so that it looks like you’re a high value male. This will then enable you to attract some of the most beautiful women in the club, every single time.

How to become a high status male:

- **Befriend a promoter (free drinks, entry and social proof)** – One of the first guys you should get to know is the promoter. He or she are great to learn from and understand how the club game works. Basically once you have a group of beautiful women with you, you can get free entry, free drinks all night and sometimes get paid.
- **Get in with the managers** – Once you’ve become chummy with the promoter, ask them to introduce you to the manager and other influential people in the club, this will shoot your social value through the roof.
- **Always hang around beautiful girls** – Once you roll into the club with a few stunners, you’ll naturally attract other girls, they will be curious as to why you’re so popular with attractive women, thus making it dead easy to talk to other women.
- **Bring other girls into your circle** – As the night goes on, bring other hot girls onto your table and offer them drinks, introduce them to your friends and just enjoy yourself.

**6. THE KEY TO CONVERSATION**

Conversation is an essential part of [building rapport](https://www.puatraining.com/blog/rapport-bonding-and-making-an-emotional-connection-with-her), attraction and escalating sexually. The better you become as a conversationalist, the more women will be attracted to you.

How to become a better conversationalist:

- **Have more fun than the girl, amuse yourself** – Always try and amuse yourself rather than pander to the girls needs. It makes you look relaxed and comfortable in your own skin.
- **Make a joke out of boring questions** – If a boring question arises like “Do you come here a lot” brush it off with a joke like “Yeah, but only for the free mints in the restroom”.
- **Become more unpredictable (keep her hooked)** – Forget logic in a conversation, take her on a journey and mix things up by throwing in random topics of conversation and taking her around the club.
- **Always lead, never let her lead the interaction** – Lead her both physically and mentally. Women want to be lead, even if they say they don’t, it’s part of their evolutionary wiring. The moment she asks you more questions than she should, turn it on it’s head and fire one back so you’re in control.

**7. ESCALATING FROM CLUB/BAR TO THE BEDROOM**

Ok, so now the important part… taking her back home. This part should actually come naturally and shouldn’t feel like a big hurdle which is what most guys view it as.

How to escalate properly:

- **Women want you to escalate (secure, confident man, killing attraction)** – Remember that women like a confident man and they want to have sex, they’re just waiting for the right guy to make them feel attraction.
- **Keep dialing up the sexual tension (small calculated risks)** – Don’t act like an on/off switch when it comes to sexual tension. You must keep dialing it up throughout the evening, take small but very calculated risks with her to see her reactions. If they are positive (meaning she doesn’t push you away) then keep going.
- **Start escalating the moment you meet her** – As soon as you introduce yourself, you should move into touching her, escalating and building attraction. You have about 30 seconds in which to make a decent first impression.

So there you go. Everything I do to attract the most beautiful women. Listen though, It does take practice, but it can definitely be achieved. Who knows, you might even end up with a model!
