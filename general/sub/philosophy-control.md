Control
===

I cannot control the outcome of my quest. I can only control myself: how I prepare, how I manage my fears, and how I conduct myself in the battle to come.

Everyone wants a guaranteed reward before they put themselves at risk. The world does not work that way. Not everyone succeeds. No matter how much you plan or prepare, a good portion of the outcome will remain in the hands of Fortune and happenstance. Generations have railed against this reality to no avail. On the other hand, you can’t succeed if you never try. Fortune tends to smile on those who act, even when the final outcome is not guaranteed. At some point, you must choose to move forward, do what you can, and hope for the best.

**Giving control to get control**

Giving up control gets control in two ways. 

First, by choosing when, where and how you give control, you still have hold of the reins. **You have defined the cage in which the other person can play.** 

Secondly, having allowed them to exercise control, you can evoke the [reciprocity principle](http://changingminds.org/principles/exchange.htm), such that the other person will willingly give up control of the conversation to redress the social balance.As someone said long ago, 'Give, in order that ye shall receive'.

**Give them choice**

When people exercise choice, they are controlling their environment. **So give them a choice, ensuring that whatever they choose gives you an advantage.**

One of the most common sales closes is the [alternative close](http://changingminds.org/disciplines/sales/closing/alternative_close.htm), where you assume the other person is ready to buy, and give them a simple choice ('Do you want the red one or the yellow one.').

Don't give them too much choice, because this makes the decision harder and can thus lead to a reduced sense of control. Because we make our easiest decisions by [contrasting](http://changingminds.org/principles/contrast.htm) two things at one time, the best number of options to give is two.

**Open questions**

[Closed questions](http://changingminds.org/techniques/questioning/open_closed_questions.htm) do not give control. In fact they can seem very controlling. [Open questions](http://changingminds.org/techniques/questioning/open_closed_questions.htm) give people the floor, letting them talk. This can be a scary step and can indeed lose all control. But you are the person who asked the question, so choose the question well to contain their response and possibly even give you information.

Just having them talk is itself a great persuader. When people talk about something themselves, they are far more likely to believe in it than if they just sit back and listen to you.

**Give them something to do**

The corollary of questioning is to give them something active to do. Just like when they are talking, actively doing something, especially when they have choice, gives a sense of control. As with questioning, when you are directing the action, you are still in overall control.

**Reflecting**

People often keep talking because they are not sure that you have really understood what they have said. When you reflect back to people what they have told you, you show them that you have heard, that they have been successful, that they have controlled their environment. This will speed the point at which they will give you back the talking stick.
