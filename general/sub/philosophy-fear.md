Fear & Courage vs Intuition

Nothing in life is to be feared it is only to be understood.

Thoughts are like waves, rising and crashing on the ocean surface.
But I am not my thoughts/ I am the ocean depth, still and unmoving during the storm.

fuck fear

We fear what we don't understand.

acknowledge and reduce it

listen to intuition

dont fear, be excited to accomplish something new


En pleine angoisse, ne pers jamais l'espoir, car la moelle la plus exquise est dans l'os le plus dur.

**when you're not sure of your next move**

Don't listen the chat between your angels and demons

Don't multiply your demons

Unity in silence —> Individuation RIGHT NOW —>Ipseité

When you overthink, your judgments get cloudy and your stress gets elevated. You spend too much time in the negative. It can become difficult to act.

**1. Awareness is the beginning of change.**

doubting or feeling stressed or anxious

step back and look at the situation and how you're responding

 In that moment of awareness is the seed of the change you want to make.

**2. Don't think of what can go wrong, but what can go right.**

single emotion: fear, it's easy to become paralyzed

Visualize all the things that can go right and keep those thoughts present and up front.

Next time you sense that you starting to spiral in that direction, stop

**3. Distract yourself into happiness.**

meditation, dancing, exercise, learning an instrument, knitting, drawing, and painting.

shut down the overanalysis.

**4. Put things into perspective.**

how much it will matter in five years ?  next month ?

changing up the time frame

**5. Stop waiting for perfection.**

we can stop waiting right now

aiming for perfection is unrealistic, impractical, and debilitating

Being ambitious is great but . The moment you start thinking "This needs to be perfect" is the moment you need to remind yourself

"Waiting for perfect is never as smart as making progress."

**6. Change your view of fear.**

Whether you're afraid because you've failed in the past

you're fearful of trying or overgeneralizing some other failure

remember that just because things did not work out before does not mean that has to be the outcome every time

Remember, every opportunity is a new beginning, a place to start again.

**7. Put a timer to work.**

Give yourself a boundary. Set a timer for five minutes and give yourself that time to think, worry, and analyze. 

spend 10 minutes with a pen and paper, writing down all the things that are worrying you, stressing you, or giving you anxiety. 

Let it rip

When the 10 minutes is up, throw the paper out and move on--preferably to something fun.

**8. Realize you can't predict the future.**

No one can predict the future; 

all we have is now. 

If you spend the present moment worrying about the future, you are robbing yourself of your time now. 

Spending time on the future is simply not productive. Spend that time instead on things that give you joy.

**9. Accept your best.**

The fear that grounds overthinking is often based in feeling that you aren't good enough--not smart enough or hardworking enough or dedicated enough. 

Once you've given an effort your best, accept it as such and know that, while success may depend in part on some things you can't control, you've done what you could do.

**10. Be grateful.**

You can't have a regretful thought and a grateful thought at the same time, so why not spend the time positively? Every morning and every evening, make a list of what you are grateful for. Get a gratitude buddy and exchange lists so you have a witness to the good things that are around you.

you can at least ward off some of the negative, anxious, stressful thinking and turn it into something useful, productive, and effective.

NO LOSE MODEL — I CANT LOSE REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF THE DECISION

WHATEVER HAPPENS TO ME, GIVEN ANY SITUATION, I CAN HANDLE IT !

DON’T FEAR, I’LL HANDLE IT

IF YOU WANT TO FEEL BETTER, DO IT

DON'T PANIC or FEAR, you will trash everything life has put on your path...

have no regrets, you're a man now, get to the next stage.

**YOU ARE ALREADY NAKED, THERE IS NO REASON NOT TO FOLLOW YOUR HEART.**

WHAT I WOULD WANT TO DO TODAY IF IT WHERE THE LAST DAY OF MY LIFE ?

If it’s No, No, No, ? Change it.

don’t fear living your life, life put things on you path ao you grow ans go deeper, if you avoid the hard path for the easy one, you’ll just grow dumb and empty

IT DOESNT MATTER, I WILL HANDLE IT

Don't feed fear, feed courage

‪fear split you in small parts, regrets eats you little by little‬. do not wait, act.

fail early

KEEP YOUR FEAR FOR YOURSELF
===

We just need to let go of the fears that keep us stuck. 

Fear doesn’t serve us. It limits us and prevents us from reaching our full potential.

Life begins where fear ends
commit fearlessly

PEOPLE FEAR/REJECT/DISLIKE WHAT THEY DONT KNOW/UNDERSTAND

stop exposing your insecurities

ask yourself

all the answers are inside

people have no right answers to give you


**How big is your unfillable hole? | Seth's Blog**

[https://seths.blog/2019/03/how-big-is-your-unfillable-hole/](https://seths.blog/2019/03/how-big-is-your-unfillable-hole/)

It doesn’t really matter, does it?

All of your bad habits (and some of your good ones) exist to fill that hole, or to protect it from being seen.

And as long as our mission is to fill the hole, and as long as the hole remains unfillable (and after all this time, if it’s not filled yet, good luck with that) it doesn’t really matter how small or trivial or unmentionable the hole is.

It still drives us.

The first step to living with it is to acknowledge it.

You can’t make it go away.

But you can learn to dance with it.

Fear doesn’t mean you’re weak: it means you’re sane. Unpleasant emotions do not dictate your actions.


Fear of the unknown will always be with you, no matter what you do. That’s comforting in a way: if there’s nothing you can do to change it, there’s no reason to let it stop you.

**I HAVE FOUND A WAY OF LIVING DIFFERENTLY.**

FEAR IS THE GREATEST WALL BETWEEN MANS.

**WHEN WE REMOVE FEAR, WE SEE CLEARLY, WE CAN FEEL EFFORTLESSLY THE ROOT CAUSE OF ALL OUR CONFLICT, WE LET UNCONDITIONAL LOVE TAKES PLACE. THAT'S THE WHAT MAKES US GODS ON EARTH. GOD IS SO POWERFUL BECAUSE HE LOVES UNCONDTIONALLY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU, WITH NO DOUBT.** 

**WHEN WE WORK TOGETHER FULL OF COMPASSION AND COMMITMENT, WE ARE CAPABLE OF THE IMPOSSIBLE. WE ACT OUT OF PERFECT BALANCE AND HARMONY. WE REGENERATE AND HEAL INSTEAD OF DESTRUCTING AND CONSUMING.** 

**OUR STRENGTH IS LOVE.**

**THAT IS WHEN MIRACLES HAPPENS.**

**LISTEN TO PEOPLE AND IF THEY ASK YOU REASSURE THEM .**


> â€œWhen a condition or a problem becomes too great, humans have the protection of not thinking about it. But it goes inward and minces up with a lot of other things already there and what comes out is discontent and uneasiness, guilt and a compulsion to get somethingâ€“anythingâ€“before it is all gone.â€ â€• John Steinbeck, The Winter of Our Discontent
