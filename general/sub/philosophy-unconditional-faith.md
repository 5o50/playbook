unconditional faith
===

UNCONDITIONAL FAITH & TRUST are just switches that turn on what is going to guide you. it  BRINGS EVERYTHING

that doesnt mean that you shoudlnt use your 2d mind. but when opposition present you dont give.

dont entertain those emotions, those oppositions. just take them into account and how you can use them. dont let them hold your attention.

how long can downs can hold your attention ?

if you sense it, it already exists.

if it already exists, and you have access to its hint. that mean it already exist and its yours if you want it.

its a battle to get it.

the deeper you go, the more the downs are harder, to awakens you to your weakness.

NEVER STOP

when you feel the dread between you and your outcome, embrace its here to show you your weaknesses. sonyou can get your dream for real

you notice something is there

can you see wifi ?

no

does it work ?

yes

in oneself — i have made up my mind — you better kill me

## C'est dieu qui donne

repeat I have faith, I have trust

and you system will show you how you don’t

it showing you what you have to maneuver

here is how much you do and how much you dont

its like a gas cage

faith is absolutely knowing unreasonably

dare like a teenager: to reach for the highest you can conceive with everything you have, and never count the cost.

THERE IS NOTHING I CANNOT HANDLE
I CAN PROVIDE EVERYTHING TO MYSELF

> im self suficient, my own advocate — Je suis maitre de mon vaisseau

Faith — Love & Peace for yourself & all & god → Widsom

> no attachement — let it be

> Faith is the strength of life.

> destination map & guidance —> conception package

> believe in your guidance — when you breathe you believe. form it and follow it

> UNCONDITIONAL FAITH/LOVE TO YOURSELF/GOD IS THE ANSWER  TO AWAKENING

> YOU UNDERSTAND THE GREATNESS OF GOD; WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT HE UNCONDITIONAL LOVE EVERY HUMAN BEING; CAN YOU PURELY LOVE EVERY ONE SOUL ? GREAT POWER LIES THERE.

> UNIVERSE IS ONE. GOD IS ONE. UNIVERSE IS GOD. TOI C'EST MOI. under the sky there is just one family and people are different

> We are lies that hold a deeper truth. Untangle the truth with love.

> how you make yourself smaller without being aware of it.

> le secret c'est de s'ecouter et de developper profondemment. et tirer les conclusions

> be your own friend; listen and unleash all your talents

> Your problem is you are too busy holding on to your unworthiness.

> UNCONDITIONAL FAITH

> C’EST DIEU QUI DONNES

> When the faith is strong enough, it is sufficient just to be. It’s a journey towards simplicity, towards quietness, towards a kind of joy that is not in time. It’s a journey that has taken us from primary identification with our body and our psyche, on to an identification with God, and ultimately beyond identification

> Deep Deep Down, you are the fabric and the existence of the universe itself. That's how much the universe love yourself. And it gave you the chance to experience it as you wish. If you want to enjoy it fully, you have to listen and be like water, balanced and harmonious. To cohabite with that. What doesnt cohabit dissapear. It's the natural selection.

if you do not love yourself, you cannot love others — love the nature

its hard to love yourself

love yourself — love others

ADD LOVE TO YOUR LIFE AND YOU WILL HAVE NO PROBLEM

DONT LOVE, BE LOVE

your are the universe experiencing itself, accept what comes out from intuition

you cannot improve.

you cant only be less desorganized and strive to come back to the right order.

The Me needs the We to create more than is possible as an individual; and the We needs Me — every Me — to come with their full capacity to create meaning collectively. ‘We’ is how we create narrative, culture, context and meaning — it’s the glue that binds us. Strip a business of the means to create We, and we all suffer as a result.”

We need to be truly ourselves as individuals, but we can only be so when connected to a greater ‘We’.
