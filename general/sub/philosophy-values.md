Values
===

*A culture’s values shape its norms.*

*Think of them as your personal compass—they give direction to the choices you make and the way you behave.*

*If you’re able to pursue activities and interests that are in line with your values and what’s important to you at a core level :*

- you will be less stressed.
- You’ll also save energy and lower conflict—internally and with others.
- Your values can point your decision making in the right direction so you can spend your time in the “right” areas for you. There’s nothing more powerful than aligning who you are with what you do and how you do it and spending your time on pursuits that have meaning to you.

 

**Sometimes values seem nebulous**. 

They can be hard to define until someone or something violates them. If you need help to clarify your values, think about some of the most memorable conflicts you’ve had in your life. Examine them closely for the essence of what really bugged you. What crossed the line? What value did that violate? Chances are, if you remember the conflict, it’s because it touched on one of your key values.

It’s important to **be clear about the meaning** behind the values you chose. Sometimes two people can have different interpretations of the same word. For example, to one person, flexibility means being agile in your work style on a day-to-day basis; to another, flexibility means being interested in working on a variety of different projects that are thrown your way.
