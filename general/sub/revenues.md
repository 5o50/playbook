Companies can have substantial revenues but still operate at a loss due to high operational costs or inefficiencies. Therefore, while annual revenue is important, it should not be viewed in isolation when assessing a company's overall financial health

Note: Revenue figures should be viewed alongside other metrics like growth rate, margins, and market potential when evaluating opportunities.
