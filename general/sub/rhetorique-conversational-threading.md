**Conversational Threading**

If you're anything like i used to be, you're not much of a conversationalist unless you've gotten to know someone quite well, which tends to be rare because you get stuck with small talk and never really empathise with another person's lived experience. Your relationships tend to be quite shallow and you find it difficult to disclose personal stories because you don't know if the other person is trustworthy. Maybe you aren't like me and you're just looking for a way to be able to discover more about people you interact with on a daily basis or speak to the girl you like on a deeper level, Perhaps you want to get further ahead in your career, or want to be able to open up to someone and have people open up to you.

Here's my own spin on a technique that I discovered called conversational threading. I'll cover the basic techniques, but each is an art on its own. I'm certainly not the master, nor am i able to provide non-equivocal strategies for social success. Each and every person you ever meet is different and this won't be a recipe of specific items and steps to success. Rather it introduces a theory, which for me, has worked in practice. How you implement the techniques described here is dependant on your own personality and that of whom you're conversing with and i would encourage you to modify it and find out what works for you on a case-by-case basis.

Conversational threading is a technique that enables you to continue conversation indefinitely without feeling like either person is "carrying" it.

**Threading Building**

A conversation with a new person or an old friend generally begins with some small talk, and follows the formula of;

- A1) "Where do you work?"
- B1) "I'm a Barista at Starbucks"
- A2) "Oh cool"
- B2) "Where do you work?"
- A3) "I'm unemployed at the moment"
- B3) "oh no!" ~ cue awkward silence followed by exit strategy.

The key here is finding the end of a conversational thread and pulling on it. In the example I've provided B1 has given us 2 thread ends, barista and starbucks. Now what you do is you need to pull on a specific thread with either a statement or a question. I prefer questions that are open and evoke an emotional response. Here's what i would have said;

- A1) "Where do you work?"
- B1) "I'm a Barista at Starbucks"
- A2) "Wow! How does it feel to be everyone's favourite person in the morning?"
- B2) " ~ I don't know, I guess when you put it that way it's kind of rewarding!, but I wouldn't say I'm everyone's favourite person!"

    Giggle

- A3) "So tell me then, who's YOUR favourite customer?"
- B3) "Well, there's always this one man who always asks for the strangest coffee combination, its basically all syrup!".

Now you have person B sharing a memory which carries an emotion instead of just stories which are facts or even worse, asking you the same question back instantly. Person B has also given you several new threads which you can pull further. Imagine it like a mindmap of getting to know the person. If in B2 they started talking about customers who are mean to them, they hate etc, I would cut the thread, but more on that later.Now this is an ideal example, not everyone will be instantly forthcoming with information;

- A1) "Where do you work?"
- B1) "I'm a Barista at Starbucks"
- A2) "Wow! How does it feel to be everyone's favourite person in the morning?"
- B2) " ~ I don't know, its alright i guess"

    Giggle

- A3) "I've always wondered, how exactly do you make all those tasty coffee's using those fancy machines?"
- B3) "Well first you do x and then y and then z".

In this example B2 isn't ready to talk about feelings per-say but asking a question which requires their specific set of knowledge forces them to teach you something, and people love to feel like they are smart. It also forces an extended response, because you can't really answer the question in two words. From the response you can continue the thread into how to become a barista, what's the most rewarding part of the job, do they like it there, childhood dreams of jobs etc...

**TL;DR: Use information a person gives you to extend the conversation with statements and open questions, instead of ignoring it**

**Thread Cutting** The idea behind this is you don't want a person to bring up negative emotions so early in a relationship, you want them to feel good around you first, and to do this you need to cut topics that are leading down negative lines or would evoke negative emotions. Whilst relationships can be built around common hatred, these are very rarely strong bonds or helpful to either party in the long term.;

- A1) "Where do you work?"
- B1) "I'm a Barista at Starbucks"
- A2) "Wow! How does it feel to be everyone's favourite person in the morning?"
- B2) "It's actually fucking terrible, i hate every minute of that job, my boss is a pervert"
- A3) "What would be your dream job instead?"
- B3) "I really love cooking, and I've wanted to be a chef since I was a 2 years old".

Here I've done 2 things, i've steered the conversation away from a negative topic and i've introduced a positive emotion to replace the negative ones. Despite the fact that she gave me threads initially, they were quite negative and I'm no street psychologist. I decided to re-frame into the positive in order to form a much stronger emotional connection, thereby associating me with feelings of "goodness" rather than "hate". Now in B3 the person has given me 3 easy to pull threads, cooking, chef, childhood.

There is another use for thread cutting. If you've been pulling a thread for too long, you may run out of steam, or get too deep and emotional to a point where it becomes uncomfortable. Staying with a thread for too long may become boring and repetitive too. Here's how you deal with it.

20 mins into conversation about childhood......

- A1) "Your dad reminds me a lot of you"
- B1) "Really, how so?"
- A2) "You've got such a warm and friendly personality and you aren't afraid to let the kid at heart out sometimes"
- B2) "Aawww thanks!"
- A3) "Do you have any plans for the summer holidays?"
- B3) "Yeah, I'm going to New York for a shopping bonanza with my friends".

Here I've cut the thread in a different way, the conversation has clearly reached its end, and i needed to explore a new thread, so I simply returned to unrelated small talk to find some new ones!

**TL;DR: Its preferred to avoid conversation that brings out negative emotions when you're just meeting someone, instead redirect into positive emotions or return to small talk to find new threads**

**Thread-Strengthening** This technique is useful when you want to explore a topic more, or someone is opening up and you want them to share more. The key here is the 3 R's. Relate, Reinforce and Repeat. Here's an example.

- A1) "Where do you work?"
- B1) "I'm a Youth Social Worker"
- A2) "That's amazing, I've always wanted to work with children, but it takes a really strong and passionate person to be able to handle that job"
- B2) "Thanks, It's definitely not a job for everyone, i've worked in 3 different areas and it's interesting to see differences within communities"
- A3) "So you've observed that youth behave differently based on their community?"
- B3) "Yeah kids from x and Y and they're more likely to do Z because of PQRST".

Here you've pulled the thread, related(working with children), reinforced(strong and passionate person), and repeated(so you've observed). It's not always necessary to do all three, but two or more generally works well. Now at B3 you can start talking about opportunities for children, their lives, how she helps, what's most rewarding etc.. You've identified her area of interest and you should explore it to see how passionate she is about what she does. This technique is perhaps the most complex, because not everyone you meet will you be able to relate with. Out of all three techniques this is perhaps the most difficult to master because quite often you'll unintentionally shift the conversation onto yourself, and her views and beliefs will not be explored and she won't connect as well.

**TL;DR: Relate to peoples experiences, Reinforce positive emotions and behaviours and Repeat to confirm understanding and appear as a good listener**

Its important to vary this up, you can't just be relating all the time, or asking only questions. A good target is to share exactly as much as the other person shares with you, and no more until you're both comfortable with freely sharing.
