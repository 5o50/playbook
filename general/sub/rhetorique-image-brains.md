Your communication is a serie of understandings

At every step you are at full agreement with the listener
Each line builds on the preeceding to led to the next.

ONLY SEND COMPLETE IMAGES!!!

WE HAVE IMAGE MIND, NOT TEXT MIND.
Understanding is IMAGE-SHARING.
IF THEY CANNOT SEE YOUR SENTENCE AS AN IMAGE, THEY CANNOT UNDERSTAND IT.
We understand images, not words.
Humain brain encode/decode images from text. If the reader get the same images as you, it measn it understand you.

**A word-image is a complete image in 10 words or less**

To form an image we expect a Sentence to be Actor + Action + persom or thing acted upon, if any.
But it's not mandatory.

Wit is using Pivot to twist the expected image coming.
Play with expect meanings.

Let's review the process. And the kinds of effects we've already gotten from it.

First, clarity results when we restrict a Pivot Word to only one meaning.

Ambiguity results when a Pivot Word has more than one meaning, and there is no way for our reader to choose between them.

Wit results when we deliberately shift, in mid-image, a Pivot Word from one meaning to another.

And a Pun results when we replace on Pivot Word with another that sounds the same, and let their two meanings interact with each other.

Which leads us to our next deliberate double meaning. This process has several names, depending on how many words or images it embraces in your writing.

If it is contained within one word, it is usually called metaphor.
If it uses several words or images, it is called symbolism.
If it uses whole paragraphs or pages or episodes, it is called allegory.

In any case, it is the same proces. That of building two mutually reinforcing meanings into the same word or image.

Metaphor is the simplest use of this process. It consists of taking a Picture Word, which has been used traditionnaly to yield a certain meaning, and using that word in a sentence which expands that meaning beyond that tradtional usage.

Une intelligence artificielle produit du "contenu", elle alimente des lignes qu'elle peut rendre plaisantes, utiles, censées, elle colle des mots les uns après les autre selon une logique probabiliste, cependant elle ne produit pas d'analyses alamniquées, pas de récits qui retournent le ventre, pas de sensibilité nue, pas d'émotions sauvages, rien de cec qui fait la splendeur et la décadence de notre fragile intelligence huhmaine. Voilà ce qu'il nous reste à transmettre.
