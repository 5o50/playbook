ðŸŽ¤ Oration Mastery

Actions/Appearance speak louder than words
Show don't tell
Une image vaut mille mots
Faire naitre une image
Want to show it's strong? Don't just say it in a billboard - glue a car to the billboard
Le sens au coeur de l'image
Articulate the words to define the image best

Audacity & Bold & Engaging
For your speech to last you cannot be half
Deliver with POWER, it informs and inspires
NO UMMM OR AHHH
Good body language
Entertain & Educate
Short, Snappy and HARD HITTING

Entertain
Excitement/Plateaux/Orgasm/Resolution
Steady rythmic stimulation upon the last and release
True wit is BLURing THEIR REALITY WITH FICTION! That is the best way to entertain and get the laugh they need.

Authenticity Engages !!
Speak from the guts 100%
Forget the camera, feel the brains

Be organically connected to the material!
Your whole body will follow: gesture, voice, intonation

Use a story to drive your message
The humain brain is better at following stories than piles of facts

Situational Awareness
Be fluid, there is no wauy to plan
Keep the attention ! 

NO EXCUSE YOU ARE LIVE, NOW ENTERTAIN!
