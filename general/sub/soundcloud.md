why soundcloud allowed so much new music to emerge around 2016

SoundCloud played a significant role in the emergence of new music, particularly around 2016, for several reasons:

Low barrier to entry: SoundCloud offered a free, user-friendly platform for artists to upload and share their music without needing a record label or distributor.
Direct artist-to-listener connection: The platform allowed artists to interact directly with fans, fostering a sense of community.
Repost and share features: These helped music spread virally, giving unknown artists a chance to gain exposure quickly.
Monetization opportunities: SoundCloud introduced its "Premier" program, allowing artists to earn money from their streams.
Algorithmic recommendations: The platform's discovery features helped listeners find new, emerging artists.
Hip-hop and electronic music focus: SoundCloud became especially popular for these genres, which were experiencing significant innovation at the time.
Mobile app popularity: As smartphone use increased, SoundCloud's mobile app made it easy for users to discover and listen to new music on the go.

These factors combined to create an environment where new, independent artists could easily share their work and gain a following, leading to the emergence of "SoundCloud rap" and other new music movements around 2016.
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or discuss specific artists or genres that emerged from SoundCloud during this period?

there isn't really a "secret sauce" or hidden trick behind SoundCloud's impact on emerging music around 2016. The factors I mentioned were the key reasons for its influence:

Easy, free uploading for artists
Direct artist-fan interaction
Viral sharing features
New monetization options
Smart recommendation algorithms
Appeal to trendsetting genres
Popular mobile app

These elements combined at the right time to create an ecosystem where new artists could easily share music and build followings. There's no hidden conspiracy or secret technique - it was simply a platform that reduced barriers for independent musicians at a time when internet culture and music consumption were rapidly evolving.
If you're looking for insights on how to replicate that kind of impact today, the landscape has changed significantly. Current strategies might involve leveraging multiple platforms, understanding evolving genre trends, and using data analytics to target audiences. But there's no magic shortcut - success in the music industry still ultimately comes down to talent, hard work, and connecting with listeners.
