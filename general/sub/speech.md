Goal Setting Speech
===

**Kennedy's speech used three strategies:**

"a characterization of space as a beckoning frontier;

an articulation of time that locates the endeavor within a historical moment of urgency and plausibility;

and a final, cumulative strategy that invites audience members to live up to their pioneering heritage by going to the Moon."[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_choose_to_go_to_the_Moon#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJordan2003214-14)

**Goal Setting is uniting people on a shared superior goal**

set **a very strong common goal** that involves everybody so people can see what are you shooting for together.

the most famous one there is John F. Kennedy’s Man on the Moon speech. But what that did, which I think is the most important, it is that it united the 400,000 people who worked on the moon project. And some of them subordinated their own agendas in pursuit of the common goal.

And you need to **seek common ground** when you are looking for crafting solutions. It cannot be just your own show, **you need involve people more**.

delegate more, at least involve other people in the decision-making process.

You need to listen well to others.

craft that compelling common **goal** to unite people

So you want to unite people, you need to articulate what the endpoint is in a **vivid** way.

the clarity of their thinking, and the scope of their ambition

hell-bent on bringing an idea to life that conventional wisdom deems impossible

we love to partner early— when an idea is newly formed and has the maximal room to grow

**BEST GOAL SETTING SPEECH**
