1. **Choose your concept** Write down everything you know about the topic on a notebook page, and add to that page every time you learn something new about it.

2. **Pretend your teaching it to a new student** Make sure you're able to explain the topic in simple terms.

3. **Whenever you get stuck, go back to the books** The gaps in your knowledge should be obvious. Revisit problem areas until you can explain the topic fully.

4. **Simplify wordy bits or create analogies.** Repeat the process while simplifying your language and connecting facts with analogies to help strengthen your understanding.

The Feynman Technique — mental model

clearly illustrate dense topics like quantum physics for virtually anybody

explain the most complex ideas in the simplest terms.

Goodstein once asked Feynman to explain why "spin one-half particles obey Fermi-Dirac." Feynman replied that he'd prepare a freshman lecture on it, but then he came back a few days later empty-handed.

I couldn't reduce it to freshman level," he admitted to Goodstein. "That means we don't really understand it." That is to say, if Feynman couldn't explain something in simple terms, there was a problem with the information, not with Feynman's teaching ability.

The Feynman Technique is laid out clearly in James Gleick's 1993 biography, ["Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman."](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679747044/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0679747044&linkCode=as2&tag=curiositydotc-20&linkId=ZOWR5DAJUAZGTEBP) In the book, Gleick explains the method in terms of how Feynman [mastered his exams](http://calnewport.com/blog/2015/11/25/the-feynman-notebook-method/) at Princeton University: "He opened a fresh notebook. On the title page, he wrote: NOTEBOOK OF THINGS I DON'T KNOW ABOUT. For the first but not last time he reorganized his knowledge. He worked for weeks at disassembling each branch of physics, oiling the parts, and putting them back together, looking all the while for the raw edges and inconsistencies. He tried to find the essential kernels of each subject." This is the first part of his process, but let's take a look at [all four steps](http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/digital-education/2014/02/04/learning-on-steroids-with-richard-feynman/):

Peer instruction makes collaboration benefit to all
===

There are similar techniques to this, one is Eric Mazur from Harvard Business School who created the ‘Peer Instruction’ approach whereby students in class are asked to vote on the solution to a problem. Their votes are counted (often using polling hardware like clickers/PRS).  Then, in a twist, Eric asks his students to find a neighbour who has a different answer, then to convince the other person that you are correct. He then finally  re-polls the audience to see if they have changed their original answers. He has year-upon-year of evidence to suggest this approach has benefits to student learning, and retention, of concepts. It’s not just that they get a theory, they can apply it to a problem, in their own language, and perhaps really synthesise it to their neighbour. I see this as the same technique, only with Feynman’s they have to convince themselves, a challenge some of us might find much harder.
