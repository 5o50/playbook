Problem solving is directed towards finding a path between a given situation and a goal situation, on completing or reorganizing mental representations (for instance, the identification of relationships between situations or of missing features in a situational frame) or serves an exploratory goal.

Problem solving is organized in stages: If no immediate response to a problem is found, the system first attempts to resort to a behavioral routine (automatism), and if this is not successful, it attempts to construct a plan. If planning fails, the system resorts to exploration (or switches to another motive). Problem solving is context dependent (contextual priming is served by associative pre-activation of mental content) and subject to modulation.

The strategies that encompass problem solving are parsimonious. They can be reflected upon and reorganized according to learning and experience. Many advanced problem solving strategies can not be adequately modeled without assuming linguistic capabilities.

in Linear Algebra, there is the following:
Given m linear equations and n unknowns (or variables), one of the following is true.
(1) If m > n, then there is no solution.
(2) If m < n, then there are infinite possible solutions.
(3) If m = n, then there is one solution.
Focusing on Eq. (3), we can say that for a well-defined problem, there is only one true solution or piece of advice that should be followed. The important thing is to be able to clearly define the problem, situation, or purpose.
