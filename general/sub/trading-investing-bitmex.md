@krispyboi first thing i noticed is u said that fees are eating ur stack. that can be solved RIGHT now by signing up a new account via another members referral link like this one. that should give u at least 10% off ur trading to start right now: https://goo.gl/qhduxG

secondly, the most taken advantage of order type is the market order

btc-trader [34 minutes ago]

open market orders are usually matched by a bot at THE WORST possible price.

if ur trying to curb fees and get a good entry, try using limit orders to buy AND sell. yea u save money selling that way as well versus blasting out of a trade via market order.

btc-trader [33 minutes ago]

obv sometimes u have too, i totally get that. but 90% of the time u should try to get a limit out of ur trade

third...

order entry methodology

btc-trader [30 minutes ago]

lets pretend you want to open a buy order on XBT of 10k contracts.

Not sure if anyone else is here - but I'm listening intently @btc-trader. Had some beginners luck first several weeks, got cocky, got hurt.

btc-trader [29 minutes ago]

personally i would break that into 4-5 trades placed on limit orders in the books within the books based on short term price range. For instance...

btc-trader [29 minutes ago]

Current Mex price is 11,385

btc-trader [28 minutes ago]

If i were staging a buy order right now i would first check the short + long term trend regarding the price direction to make sure im going with the flow obv.

btc-trader [28 minutes ago]

then...

btc-trader [27 minutes ago]

i would spread 3-4 orders at 11,375 for 1k contracts / 11,360 for 1k contracts / 11,345 1k contracts / 11.325 for 3k contracts / 11.305 for 4k contracts

btc-trader [26 minutes ago]

those levels are all based on the range we have been trading in on the M3 chart the last 7-10 candles

btc-trader [25 minutes ago]

Shotgunning your total contract spend across various lower price points works wonders as u can prob gather by doing the math

btc-trader [25 minutes ago]

noticed that you said u had lost most of that BTC cuz of chopiness

btc-trader [25 minutes ago]

Chop is my favorite thing to scalp trade.

btc-trader [24 minutes ago]

Like right now, this is SO predictably range bound.

btc-trader [24 minutes ago]

i usually trade the chop with 100x leverage.

btc-trader [24 minutes ago]

Oh, ordersize versus account size.

btc-trader [23 minutes ago]

IMO u should NEVER open an order that is more than 10% of ur total trading stack at any given time. never never. by doing it this way, you have 90% of ur money left to work urself out of a bad trade (being that u have the confidence to do so) or decreasing ur leverage / increasing ur margin on the live trade
