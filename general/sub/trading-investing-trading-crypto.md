whale movement = LARGE ENOUGH CRYPTO TRANSACTION TO DISRUPT THE PRICE OF A CRYPTOCURRENCY

FOR CRYPTOCURRENCIES
CHECK 1: COIN TOP HOLDERS -> Decentralized more stable / centralized more risky more reward
CHECK 2: COINS ON EXCHANGE: may sell may not / COINS ON COLDSTORAGE WILL NOT SELL SURE
if you see 100 millions being sent to an exchange this could crash the price
if you see 100 millions being from exchange to unknown wallet, they will not sell anytime soon
if a lot of off exchange txs --> rocket fuel for upward price mvmt cuz of supply shortage

FOR STABLECOINS
inverse

Exchane to Exchange equals ARBITRAGE

wallet to wallet tx equals OTC trade

How much money can move the market
==> check Market Depth on CMC

If Whale Txs come from oldest and top holder of a cc ---> ABANDON SHIP
SAME FOR CELEBS / DEVS / FOUNDERS

WYCKOFF METHOD

--> SMART MONEY IS VERY AWARD OF RETAIL INVESTOR BEHAVIOUR
--> SMART MONEY IS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO MESS UP YOUR HEAD

" ... all the fluctuations in the market and in all the various stocks should be
studied as if they were the result of one man's operations. Let us call him the
Composite Man, who in theory, sits behind the scenes and manipulates the stocks
to your disadvantage if you do not understand the game as he plays it;
and to your great profit if you do understand it." - Richard D. Wyckoff

Instead of looking at behavioural patterns they just look for areas that are packed with investors who are waiting to buy or sell.

Institutional will crash the market but they dont want to put it to zero
they may put it more money to save it so they keep milking the cow,

To find a smart money wallet, we're going to look for a recent successful project, and we'll say that its 2-3 biggest minters are "smart money wallets".
