0) Commit: Don't Pivot, figure it out. : human tendency is wishful thinking, so the challenge to entrepreneurs is telling what's the difference between really believing in your ideals and sticking to them as opposed to pursuing some unrealistic dream that doesn't actually have merit, be very rigorous in your self analysis, certainly being extremely tenacious, and just work like hell.
1) set the vision and strategy for the company
2) evangelize the company to everyone
3) hire and manage the team, especially in areas where you yourself have gaps
4) raise money, and
5) set the execution quality bar.

But when you commit - then magic happens.
COMMITMENT over ambition
Concerning  all acts of initiative (and creation), there is one elementary truth  that ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: that  the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves too."

Butterflies and peer network
The Butterfly Metaphor For Change
BY RICH LITVIN
When we think of change we often picture the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a butterfly.
My little boys love the story of The Hungry Caterpillar, so even they know that after a period of ravenous consumption, a caterpillar finds a perch and forms a chrysalis.
Let some time pass and out pops a butterfly, right?
I learned recently is that there is actually NO structural similarity at all between a caterpillar and a butterfly. They are completely different creatures.
â€œInside the chrysalis, the caterpillarâ€”unable to moveâ€”dissolves into organic goop.
Cells, which had been dormant in the caterpillar and which biologists have the poetic genius to call â€œImaginal cells,â€ begin a process of creating a new form and structure.
At first these Imaginal cellsâ€”the seeds of future potential, which contain the blueprint of a flying creatureâ€”operate independently as single-cell organisms. They are regarded as threats and are attacked by the caterpillarâ€™s immune system.
But they persist, multiply, and connect with each other. The Imaginal cells form clusters and clumps, begin resonating at the same frequency and passing information back and forth until they hit a tipping point.
They begin acting not as discrete individual cells but as a multi-cell organismâ€”and a butterfly is born.â€ â€“ Rob Evans & Carolyn Buck Luce
And this makes the butterfly metaphor for change even more powerful.
You see, leadership is lonely. And it doesnâ€™t need to be that way.
Part of your mission is to seek out change-makers like yourself.
As Margaret Mead says:
â€œNever doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed people can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has.â€
Love. Rich

the mirroring hypothesis
organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations. â€”â€‰M. Conway
If the parts of an organization (e.g., teams, departments, or subdivisions) do not closely reflect the essential parts of the product, or if the relationship between organizations do not reflect the relationships between product parts, then the project will be in trouble ... Therefore: Make sure the organization is compatible with the product architecture.[
    Organisations often produce web sites with a content and structure which mirrors the internal concerns of the organisation rather than the needs of the users of the site.
There are internet companies (like Basecamp, or like Automattic, makers of WordPress, where I work) that charge money for their products and services, and use that money to grow their business. I wish more internet companies could follow that model, but itâ€™s hard to retrofit a legitimate business model to a product that started its life as free.
Websites and internet startups used to be you and your friends making cool stuff for your other friends, and maybe building new friendships and even small communities in the process. (Even in 2019, thatâ€™s still how some websites and startups beginâ€”as labors of love, fashioned by idealists in their spare time.)

Layer 3 â€” Peer Apprentice     â€” Understand the mission and commit to serve the mission
  Directly serves the Peerates
  Upper Mantle
Observation 1:Without discipline and training, all inborn talents are useless
  Perfection comes from repetition
  Contrary to popular belief, a Peer is made not born.
  Yes, the candidate has to have certain talents but it is the training as a Padawan that truly creates a Jedi Master. 
  A study from the University of Illinois supports the idea that leaders are made, not born and that leadership development follows a specific progression.
  According to researcher David Rosch, a person must be ready, willing and able to be mentored and trained just like a Peer apprentice.
  Based on these findings and with reference to Brigette Hyacinth, the author of The Edge of Leadership: A Leaderâ€™s Handbook for Success, we can safely conclude that leadership is an art rather than science, it is a set of innate traits, refined and perfected over time with education, training and experience.
16. Peer make a commitment to their cause and to humanity.
  Our ideals, philosophies, and practices define the belief of Peerism and we take action on this path for self-improvement and to help others. We are both the witnesses and protectors of the Peer way by the practice of our convictions.
Peer are in touch with the Peace.
We are open to spiritual awareness and keep our minds in tune with the beauty of the world. We are forever learning and open our minds to experiences and knowledge of ourselves and others.
Training: To know one's ignorance.
  A Jedi knows there is always something more to learn and seeks new lessons every day.
Pure Motive: To act with motive and purpose.
  Without a sound motive and purpose, action has no meaning, no destination and lacks a foundation. A Jedi moves with the Force, trusts in its ways. A Jediâ€™s actions are firmly based upon a deep motivation to be as their path dictates.
Honesty: To avoid lies.
  A Jedi is honest with themselves and seeks to always go beyond appearances. There can be no honest self without the knowledge and wisdom to see truth.
9. Peer have integrity.
  We are authentic to what we believe and are open, honest and true to our purpose and our minds. We remove all masks to reveal ourselves as courageous and noble of heart. We do not hide from fear of damage to our image because we know that our image cannot be blemished from the words and actions of others.
Focus: To select what matters most.
  A Peer focuses in the task at hand. Although a Jedi is aware of the past, and wary of the present's impact on the future, through discipline they know how to select and concentrate on priorities.
Harmony: To be connected to the Peace.
  A Peer seeks to live in harmony with the Peace, for that is the reason to be a Peer. To better understand its ways, to better know one's place within it.
Meditation: To exercise the mind.
  Through regular meditation a Peer examines their motivations, and are certain that they are not allowing emotion, ignorance, or passion to intrude upon them. Meditation can be used by a Peer to improve their mindfulness, focus, or patience.
2. Peer maintain a clear mind;
  which can be achieved through meditation and contemplation. Our minds can become unduly troubled and concerned with the happenings of the world. We must work on overcoming our individual issues through training and diligence.
4. Peer are wary of attachments, both material and personal.
  The obsession over possessions and people creates the fear of losing those possessions and relationships which can cause ourselves to be trapped in a state of depression and loss.
10. Peer serve in many ways.

  Mantle
  KNIGHTS SELECT PEERATES TO BECOME APPRENTICES.
  Innovators: "Individuals who made outstanding technological, commercial, or policy advances and helped to expand the Peer reach."
5. Peer understand that well-being consists in the physical, the mental and the spiritual.
  A Peer trains each to ensure they remain capable of performing their duties to the best of their ability. All of these are interconnected and essential parts of our training in becoming more harmonious with the Force.
3. Peer are aware of the future impacts of action and inaction and of the influence of the past, but live in and focus on the Now.
  We let ourselves flow like water through the events around us. We embrace the ever changing and fluid world, adapting and changing as it does.
Observation 3: Not every good decision is explainable with reasons
  Intuition is another key leadership trait in a Jedi Master. You would notice how Master Yoda would always sense when there is something wrong or when something is about to go wrong.
  In fact, Master Yoda first rejected the acceptance of young Anakin Skywalker as a Padawan learner but it was after the insistence of Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan saying that Anakin is the chosen one and will be the one that brings balance to the Force, that Yoda eventually gave in.
  According to John C. Maxwell, leaders look at things differently than others. They evaluate everything according to their leadership bias. They possess leadership intuition that informs everything they do and it is an inseparable part of who they are.
WE INCREASE increase intuition, spontaneity, gratitude, compassion, clarity
WE ARE  â€” HEART & INTUITION FIRST â€” BEFORE MIND â€” JUST INTUITION
keep balance â€” BODY - MIND - HEART - SOUL
  FITNESS & MEDITATION & TALKS
14. Peer are guardians of peace.
  We believe in helping all those that are in need, in whatever form, to the best of our ability. We recognise that sometimes providing help requires courage in the face of adversity but understand that conflict is resolved through peace, understanding and harmony.
8. Peer are patient.
  We work on training ourselves not to precipitate events around us. We know that becoming a Jedi is long and hard and requires rigorous dedication and commitment. Jedi train to act with a conscientious state of calmness.
6. Peer use their skills to the best of their ability.
  We do not use our knowledge and skill to boast or be prideful. We are mindful of the ego and mindful of our actions, exercising wisdom and humility.
7. Peer understand their limitations.
  We recognise, and take responsibility, for our failures and develop a level of modesty about them. We respect the right for others to disagree and understand that they themselves are not perfect.
Intervention: To know when not to act.
  A Peer knows how inaction can have as great an impact as action and how some of the greatest lessons are self-taught. To be a victor is also taking that victory from those you protect. A Peer intervenes only when a Peer's intervention is required.
Integrity: To be consistent.
  A Peer lives as a Peer at all times. Hypocrisy is their worst enemy.
Nobility: To act with honour.
  A Peer does not engage in petty, mean or otherwise dubious activities. Acting with stature and distinction influences others, offering a compelling example of what can be achieved by those who follow Peer.
Conflict: To know when to fight.
  A Peer knows the conflicting nature of the Force but they also know its peace and serenity. A Peer never blindly enters conflict and always does so for the greater good.
Courage: To have the will.
  To be a Peer sometimes means choosing the more difficult path, the personally expensive one. A Jedi knows they must make the right choice, take the right side and that the weak they have sworn to defend often stand alone. A Jedi puts aside fear, regret, and uncertainty yet knows the difference between courage and sheer stupidity.
Discipline: To let the self be sole master of the self.
  A Peer's mind is structured, peaceful, unencumbered by emotions, physical state or external stimuli.
Fearlessness: To have no self-imposed limits.
  Fear is that which prevents a Jedi from accomplishing their duty. A Jedi learns to let go of their fears through their faith in the Force and has no shame in admitting their shortfalls when they occur.
  Go through your limits.
  you can do anything
Prowess: To seek excellence in all endeavors expected of a Peer.
  A Peer strives to acquire greater skill and expertise in what they do at all times so that it may be used in the service of the greater good, and not for personal profit. This requires discipline, patience and perfect practice.
Defense: To defend the way of Jediism.
  A Peer is sworn by oath to defend their faith and all it encompasses.

  I AM A MASTER NOW. â€” NO RETURN EN ARRIERE.
12. Peer believe that love and compassion are central to their lives.
  We must love and care for each other as we must love and care for ourselves; by doing this we envelop all life in the positivity of our actions and thoughts. We are providers and beacons of hope.
I cannot give you the answers, you have to find out what to do; while playing with others. (INTUITION AND HARMONIZE)
  BELIEVE IN YOUR INTUITION â€” WE WILL AWAKEN YOUR INTUITION BEYOND YOUR LIMITS.
Order & efficiency â€” Organization and planning
11. Peer are mindful of their thoughts.
  We recognise the beauty in others and we provide help to those who come seeking it. Through our benevolent actions we strengthen not only ourselves but also our communities. Peer act without prejudice.
Management
  when I take a decision, we have to stick with it as a team. and play out our best to get the best outcome. that what will make us GREAT. 
  keep the ship straight no matter what, you have to genuinely trust me, I deeply believe in communication.
  there is not hierarchy of skill â€” of an over representation of some kind of collaborator profiles
  "Good products require a certain level of dictatorship, otherwise it will contain a lot of different opinions and fragment product character."
  YOU ARE AN EXTENSION OF MYSELF.
  I love you unconditionally.
  Be consistent and repeat
  An â€œopen organizationâ€â€”which I define as an organization that engages participative communities both inside and outâ€”responds to opportunities more quickly, has access to resources and talent outside the organization, and inspires, motivates, and empowers people at all levels to act with accountability.
  â€œTo put it bluntly, the most important task for any manager today is to create a work environment that inspires exceptional contribution and that merits an outpouring of passion, imagination and initiative.â€
  as a leader, you should be working very intentionally to spark as much emotion and passion as you can among your team rather than worrying about running the kinds of conventional management studies that try to measure how hard or fast people are working.
  TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE CREATIVE AND CREATE IDEAS AND MEET THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO BUILD
  hired the best minds, 
  told them something awesome to build and 
  screamed at them until they got it right. 
  Then, took the credit once it was completed. Rinse and repeat.
  NO STOCK FOR EMPLOYEES.
  NO INVESTORS.

3. Treat your employees well but do NOT overpay them.
  Treat your employees well by giving them insurances, paid vacations & trips, surprises bonuses, gifts and such. Do NOT give them a large payout even if they're pressing or shipping hundreds of thousands of pills. If someone becomes too comfortable with his pay, his quality of work will lower. you have to keep your employees dependant on you. Overpaying employees = Bad work. Double loss. For example in my own company all employees have a health insurance. they are allowed up to 1500/month in private medical, psychological bills paid by my expense) If not used, it will be given as a bonus vacation trip every couple months. Any lawyer time they might need for questions is also paid by the company.
4. Don't hire people under 30 years old
  Both in the administrative and executive field. People under 30 years old are reckless, like to hang out in bars and brag to friends. People over 30 years old (get 40,50+ if you can) tend to be more straight with their shit. Much less likely to steal or botch the work and normally know the value of money. If you can get someone 40 yo+ that doesn't have a record, its most likely someone who already had a full-time job and knows how to work decently and not do dirty shit. Im 20 btw.
11. Trust buffers.

Monitoring Values
  Youâ€™ve picked your top five values and have defined what they mean to you. But are you living in alignment? Are you building your life around whatâ€™s important to you? Itâ€™s time to see if youâ€™re â€œwalking the talkâ€ through a quick self-assessment.
for each collaborator give a note from 1(I am really not living this value) to 5 (I live this value so consistently, I could be the poster child for this value). Think about whether or not others would be able to see this value in your day-to-day interactions. Be honest!
Select the one or two values that you feel are most critical to your success and happiness and that are potentially the most out of whack in your current lifestyle.
Come up with a plan on how you can bring this value back into focus. Make commitments. So, if your top value is health, and youâ€™re always parked on a couch chowing down chips and soda, make a change.
up your commitment level is to identify an accountability partner who can keep you motivated, honest, and on track. Studies also show that it takes 21 days to change a behavior into a habit.

Who mistakes happens when managers :
    - are unclear about what is needed in a job

    - Lose candidate they really want to join their team
There is no shortcut in becoming a great leader. It is a process that requires much discipline.
So leaders, as we work towards becoming better leaders, in the famous words of Yoda, â€œDo, or do not. There is no try.â€
Which means even Mozart â€“ who had essentially every advantage when it comes to becoming a brilliant musician â€“ still had to practice 
his skills for a full 10 years before creating anything great!

 the mirroring hypothesis
 organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations. â€”â€‰M. Conway
 If the parts of an organization (e.g., teams, departments, or subdivisions) do not closely reflect the essential parts of the product, or if the relationship between organizations do not reflect the relationships between product parts, then the project will be in trouble ... Therefore: Make sure the organization is compatible with the product architecture.[
    Organisations often produce web sites with a content and structure which mirrors the internal concerns of the organisation rather than the needs of the users of the site.
 There are internet companies (like Basecamp, or like Automattic, makers of WordPress, where I work) that charge money for their products and services, and use that money to grow their business. I wish more internet companies could follow that model, but itâ€™s hard to retrofit a legitimate business model to a product that started its life as free.
 Websites and internet startups used to be you and your friends making cool stuff for your other friends, and maybe building new friendships and even small communities in the process. (Even in 2019, thatâ€™s still how some websites and startups beginâ€”as labors of love, fashioned by idealists in their spare time.)

 Layer 3 â€” Peer Apprentice     â€” Understand the mission and commit to serve the mission
   Directly serves the Peerates
   Upper Mantle
 Observation 1:Without discipline and training, all inborn talents are useless
   Perfection comes from repetition
   Contrary to popular belief, a Peer is made not born.
   Yes, the candidate has to have certain talents but it is the training as a Padawan that truly creates a Jedi Master. 
   A study from the University of Illinois supports the idea that leaders are made, not born and that leadership development follows a specific progression.
   According to researcher David Rosch, a person must be ready, willing and able to be mentored and trained just like a Peer apprentice.
   Based on these findings and with reference to Brigette Hyacinth, the author ofÂ The Edge of Leadership: A Leaderâ€™s Handbook for Success, we can safely conclude that leadership is an art rather than science, it is a set of innate traits, refined and perfected over time with education, training and experience.
 16.Â Peer make a commitment to their cause and to humanity.
   Our ideals, philosophies, and practices define the belief of Peerism and we take action on this path for self-improvement and to help others. We are both the witnesses and protectors of the Peer way by the practice of our convictions.
 1.Â Peer are in touch with the Peace.
   We are open to spiritual awareness and keep our minds in tune with the beauty of the world. We are forever learning and open our minds to experiences and knowledge of ourselves and others.
 Training:Â To know one's ignorance.
   A Jedi knows there is always something more to learn and seeks new lessons every day.
 Pure Motive:Â To act with motive and purpose.
   Without a sound motive and purpose, action has no meaning, no destination and lacks a foundation. A Jedi moves with the Force, trusts in its ways. A Jediâ€™s actions are firmly based upon a deep motivation to be as their path dictates.
 Honesty:Â To avoid lies.
   A Jedi is honest with themselves and seeks to always go beyond appearances. There can be no honest self without the knowledge and wisdom to see truth.
 9.Â Peer have integrity.
   We are authentic to what we believe and are open, honest and true to our purpose and our minds. We remove all masks to reveal ourselves as courageous and noble of heart. We do not hide from fear of damage to our image because we know that our image cannot be blemished from the words and actions of others.
 Focus:Â To select what matters most.
   A Peer focuses in the task at hand. Although a Jedi is aware of the past, and wary of the present's impact on the future, through discipline they know how to select and concentrate on priorities.
 Harmony:Â To be connected to the Peace.
   A Peer seeks to live in harmony with the Peace, for that is the reason to be a Peer. To better understand its ways, to better know one's place within it.
 Meditation:Â To exercise the mind.
   Through regular meditation a Peer examines theirÂ motivations, and are certain that they are not allowing emotion, ignorance, or passion to intrude upon them.Â Meditation can be used by a Peer to improve their mindfulness, focus, or patience.
 2.Â Peer maintain a clear mind;
   which can beÂ achieved through meditation and contemplation. Our minds can become unduly troubled and concerned with the happenings of the world. We must work on overcoming our individual issues through training and diligence.
 4.Â Peer are waryÂ of attachments, both material and personal.
   The obsession over possessions and people creates the fear of losing those possessions and relationships which can cause ourselves to be trapped in a state of depression and loss.
 10.Â Peer serve in many ways.

   Mantle
   KNIGHTS SELECT PEERATES TO BECOME APPRENTICES.
   Innovators: "Individuals who made outstanding technological, commercial, or policy advances and helped to expand the Peer reach."
 5.Â Peer understand that well-being consists in the physical, the mental and the spiritual.
   A Peer trains each to ensure they remain capable of performing their duties to the best of their ability. All of these are interconnected and essential parts of our training in becoming more harmonious with the Force.
 3.Â Peer are aware of the future impacts of action and inaction and of the influence of the past, but live in and focus on the Now.
   We let ourselves flow like water through the events around us. We embrace the ever changing and fluid world, adapting and changing as it does.
 Observation 3: Not every good decision is explainable with reasons
   Intuition is another key leadership trait in a Jedi Master. You would notice how Master Yoda would always sense when there is something wrong or when something is about to go wrong.
   In fact, Master Yoda first rejected the acceptance of young Anakin Skywalker as a Padawan learner but it was after the insistence of Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan saying that Anakin is the chosen one and will be the one that brings balance to the Force, that Yoda eventually gave in.
   According to John C. Maxwell, leaders look at things differently than others. They evaluate everything according to their leadership bias. They possess leadership intuition that informs everything they do and it is an inseparable part of who they are.
 WE INCREASE increase intuition, spontaneity, gratitude, compassion, clarity
 WE ARE  â€” HEART & INTUITION FIRST â€” BEFORE MIND â€” JUST INTUITION
 keep balance â€” BODY - MIND - HEART - SOUL
   FITNESS & MEDITATION & TALKS
 14.Â Peer are guardians of peace.
   We believe in helping all those that are in need, in whatever form, to the best of our ability. We recognise that sometimes providing help requires courage in the face of adversity but understand that conflict is resolved through peace, understanding and harmony.
 8.Â Peer are patient.
   We work on training ourselves not to precipitate events around us. We know that becoming a Jedi is long and hard and requires rigorous dedication and commitment. Jedi train to act with a conscientious state of calmness.
 6.Â Peer use their skills to the best of their ability.
   We do not use our knowledge and skill to boast or be prideful. We are mindful of the ego and mindful of our actions, exercising wisdom and humility.
 7.Â Peer understand their limitations.
   We recognise, and take responsibility, for our failures and develop a level of modesty about them. We respect the right for others to disagree and understand that they themselves are not perfect.
 Intervention:Â To know when not to act.
   A Peer knows how inaction can have as great an impact as action and how some of the greatest lessons are self-taught. To be a victor is also taking that victory from those you protect. A Peer intervenes only when a Peer's intervention is required.
 Integrity:Â To be consistent.
   A Peer lives as a Peer at all times. Hypocrisy is their worst enemy.
 Nobility:Â To act with honour.
   A Peer does not engage in petty, mean or otherwise dubious activities. Acting with stature and distinction influences others, offering a compelling example of what can be achieved by those who follow Peer.
 Conflict:Â To know when to fight.
   A Peer knows the conflicting nature of the Force but they also know its peace and serenity. A Peer never blindly enters conflict and always does so for the greater good.
 Courage:Â To have the will.
   To be a Peer sometimes means choosing the more difficult path, the personally expensive one. A Jedi knows they must make the right choice, take the right side and that the weak they have sworn to defend often stand alone.Â A Jedi puts aside fear, regret, and uncertainty yet knows the difference between courage and sheer stupidity.
 Discipline:Â To let the self be sole master of the self.
   A Peer's mind is structured, peaceful, unencumbered by emotions, physical state or external stimuli.
 Fearlessness:Â To have no self-imposed limits.
   Fear is that which prevents a Jedi from accomplishing their duty. A Jedi learns to let go of their fears through their faith in the Force and has no shame in admitting their shortfalls when they occur.
   Go through your limits.
   you can do anything
 Prowess:Â To seek excellence in all endeavors expected of a Peer.
   A Peer strives to acquire greater skill and expertise in what they do at all times so that it may be used in the service of the greater good, and not for personal profit. This requires discipline, patience and perfect practice.
 Defense:Â To defend the way of Jediism.
   A Peer is sworn by oath to defend their faith and all it encompasses.

   expÃ©rience en temps de guerre et une expertise dans les rapports diplomatiques
   MASTER ELECTS APPRENTICES TO KNIGHTS.
   I AM A MASTER NOW. â€” NO RETURN EN ARRIERE.
 12.Â Peer believe that love and compassion are central to theirÂ lives.
   We must love and care for each other as we must love and care for ourselves; by doing this we envelop all life in the positivity of our actions and thoughts. We are providers and beacons of hope.
 I cannot give you the answers, you have to find out what to do; while playing with others. (INTUITION AND HARMONIZE)
   BELIEVE IN YOUR INTUITION â€” WE WILL AWAKEN YOUR INTUITION BEYOND YOUR LIMITS.
 Order & efficiency â€” Organization and planning
 11.Â Peer are mindful of their thoughts.
   We recognise the beauty in others and we provide help to those who come seeking it. Through our benevolent actions we strengthen not only ourselves but also our communities. Peer act without prejudice.
 Management
   when I take a decision, we have to stick with it as a team. and play out our best to get the best outcome. that what will make us GREAT. 
   keep the ship straight no matter what, you have to genuinely trust me, I deeply believe in communication.
   there is not hierarchy of skill â€” of an over representation of some kind of collaborator profiles
   "Good products require a certain level of dictatorship, otherwise it will contain a lot of different opinions and fragment product character."
   YOU ARE AN EXTENSION OF MYSELF.
   I love you unconditionally.
   Be consistent and repeat
   An â€œopen organizationâ€â€”which I define as an organization that engages participative communities both inside and outâ€”responds to opportunities more quickly, has access to resources and talent outside the organization, and inspires, motivates, and empowers people at all levels to act with accountability.
   â€œTo put it bluntly, the most important task for any manager today is to create a work environment that inspires exceptional contribution and that merits an outpouring of passion, imagination and initiative.â€
   as a leader, you should be working very intentionally to spark as much emotion and passion as you can among your team rather than worrying about running the kinds of conventional management studies that try to measure how hard or fast people are working.
   TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE CREATIVE AND CREATE IDEAS AND MEET THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO BUILD
   hired the best minds, 
   told them something awesome to build and 
   screamed at them until they got it right. 
   Then, took the credit once it was completed. Rinse and repeat.
   NO STOCK FOR EMPLOYEES.
   NO INVESTORS.
   FULLY INDEPENDANT COMPANY
 3. Treat your employees well but do NOT overpay them.
   Treat your employees well by giving them insurances, paid vacations & trips, surprises bonuses, gifts and such. Do NOT give them a large payout even if they're pressing or shipping hundreds of thousands of pills. If someone becomes too comfortable with his pay, his quality of work will lower. you have to keep your employees dependant on you. Overpaying employees = Bad work. Double loss. For example in my own company all employees have a health insurance. they are allowed up to 1500/month in private medical, psychological bills paid by my expense) If not used, it will be given as a bonus vacation trip every couple months. Any lawyer time they might need for questions is also paid by the company.
 4. Don't hire people under 30 years old
   Both in the administrative and executive field. People under 30 years old are reckless, like to hang out in bars and brag to friends. People over 30 years old (get 40,50+ if you can) tend to be more straight with their shit. Much less likely to steal or botch the work and normally know the value of money. If you can get someone 40 yo+ that doesn't have a record, its most likely someone who already had a full-time job and knows how to work decently and not do dirty shit. Im 20 btw.
 11. Trust buffers.
 Keep "jokers"

 Dont trust the resume
 Dont trust your guts
 A Player: superstar, right superstar, a talented person who can fo the job you need done, while fitting in with the culture of your company.
 A player: a candidate who has at least 90% chance of achieving a set of outcomes that only the top 10% of possible candidates could achieve.
 90% chance of succedding the job not 50%
 Have a 90% chance of accomplishing what only 10% of possible hires could accomplish.
 Monitoring Values
   Youâ€™ve picked your top five values and have defined what they mean to you. But are you living in alignment? Are you building your life around whatâ€™s important to you? Itâ€™s time to see if youâ€™re â€œwalking the talkâ€ through a quick self-assessment.
 for each collaborator give a note from 1(I am really not living this value) to 5 (I live this value so consistently, I could be the poster child for this value). Think about whether or not others would be able to see this value in your day-to-day interactions. Be honest!
 Select the one or two values that you feel are most critical to your success and happiness and that are potentially the most out of whack in your current lifestyle.
 Come up with a plan on how you can bring this value back into focus. Make commitments. So, if your top value is health, and youâ€™re always parked on a couch chowing down chips and soda, make a change.
 up your commitment level is to identify an accountability partner who can keep you motivated, honest, and on track. Studies also show that it takes 21 days to change a behavior into a habit.

 The most interesting fact as far as engagement is concerned is that pay isnâ€™t even on the list! While fair compensation will always be a key component of job satisfaction, the research shows us that itâ€™s not necessarily a day-to-day motivator of engagement. The conclusion for organizations everywhere is this: Employee engagement can never be bought; it must be earned.
 Psychological meaningfulness: a sense that their work was worthwhile and made a difference.

 In fact, music was actually therapeutic for Wolfgang. As a child, he had a problem with mood swings and lashing out at others â€“ unless he was fully immersed in music.

 This gave him extra motivation to continue practicing and pushing his limits in order to play as well as his older sister.

 Observation 5: Leadership is always a choice â€“ painful but rewarding
   â€œTraining to become a Peer is not an easy challenge, and even if you succeed, itâ€™s a hard life"
   To be a great leader in the Peer Order, one must possess great discipline, as becoming a great Peer leader is a process and is not something that can be done in a day.
   The process helps develop and hone your skills that will help make you an effective leader. All young Padawan learners in the Peer Temple have immense discipline to go through their training to become a Peer Knight and eventually a Master. The Peer Grand Master Yoda himself only became a master at the age of 96!
 Observation 4: Sometimes, you donâ€™t have to be whatâ€™s expected of you
 INTUITION AND EMPATHY
 The Peer Master Code
 No Emotion â€” Peace
 No Ignorance â€” Knowledge
 No Passion â€” Serenity
 No Chaos â€” Harmony
 No Death â€” Life
 Morality:Â To know the danger of belief.
   A Peer knows how contradicting beliefs of what is right and wrong can lead to devastating crimes and conflicts. A Peer takes a step away from the subjectivity of opinion in favour of the peace of objectivity. A Peer does not force their values upon others.
 Humility:Â To accept the ego for what it is.
   A Jedi does not boast of their accomplishments and knows that their accomplishment is its own reward.
 Justice:Â To always seek the path of â€˜rightâ€™.
   A Peer is unencumbered by bias or personal interest. Justice is a double-edged sword, one that protects the weak, yet also passes judgements according to a set of values. A Peer tolerates that which is not Peer and does not pass judgement on that which causes no harm for it is just.
 Discretion:Â To become invisible.
   A Jedi knows there is a time and place for all things. They do not actively interfere in worldly affairs and refrain from overtly supporting or opposing other individuals or organizations.
 Loyalty:Â To have faith in your Peers brothers and sisters.
   A Peer remains true to what they have learned and to their own teachings. A Peer always serves those who wish to learn more of the ways of the Force and in doing so, remain loyal to the way of Peerism and their Team.
 13.Â Peer cultivate empathy.
   We try to view things from anotherâ€™s perspective making us sensitive listeners. We provide the confidence people need when talking through their difficulties and we share our learning with those who would benefit. We do this to help create a more harmonious society.Â

 The most interesting fact as far as engagement is concerned is that pay isnâ€™t even on the list! While fair compensation will always be a key component of job satisfaction

  the research shows us that itâ€™s not necessarily a day-to-day motivator of engagement. The conclusion for organizations everywhere is this: Employee engagement can never be bought; it must be earned.

  The Heartbeat
  
  The best companies I work with have a heartbeat, they operate on a pace and a cadence and a rhythm that is perceptible to everyone in and around the company.
  
  I am not talking about just product and engineering, although you canâ€™t have a company with a heartbeat if you donâ€™t have it in product and engineering. A company that doesnâ€™t ship product regularly builds clogged arteries and that becomes pervasive in the culture and you end up with low morale, a lack of confidence, a revolving door, and a mess.
  
  There are many ways to get this beat going and sustain it. There are techniques like agile product development, monthly and quarterly OKRs, weekly show and tells at the all-hands meeting, metrics meetings, etc, etc.
  
  What it comes down to in my view is a mindset around getting stuff done on a regular cadence and then letting that rhythm become a wave and riding that wave.
  
  And it starts with the CEO. They are the drummer in the band. They set the beat and keep the beat. And everyone plays around it.
  
  If you have been in a company that has a heartbeat, you know what I am talking about.
  
  If you havenâ€™t, then you need to find one and join it and learn how it feels.
  
  Because a heartbeat is what you want in your company.
  
  Keep the Team Output and volocity at the highest levels on the right thingsthe most important thing a CEO or executive must do is to keep the output and velocity of the team at the highest levels and focused on doing the right things.

The success of the iPhone keyboard had, apparently, enhanced my standing.

  From my standpoint, as an individual programmer, demoing to Steve was like visiting the Oracle of Delphi. The demo was my question. Steveâ€™s response was the answer.

  **The mere presence of other people can boost your performance.**
One the earliest findings in social psychology was the â€œsocial facilitationâ€ effect â€“ the way the mere presence of other people engaged in the same task as us can boost our motivation. In 1920, [social psychologist Floyd Allport showed](http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/Allport/Allport_1920a.html) that a group of people working individually at the same table performed better on a whole range of tasks even though they werenâ€™t cooperating or competing. Allportâ€™s research illustrates how the energy of other people can act as a substitute team even if weâ€™re working solo (this is why many creatives enjoy working at their local cafÃ© surrounded by industrious strangers).
**A familiar team has benefits like a home stadium.**
compete in the familiar surroundings of their home stadium
having familiar faces around you
By working repeatedly with the same people, you get to know their strengths and weaknesses
you have shared experiences to draw on
you develop unspoken habits and rules that aid your mutual understanding
A related lesson here: take a star performer out of their usual team environment and you might find their performance disappoints
  - It's not collaboration
- when teams conform to the *lowest common denominator* for political reasons
- when managers insist that every person's opinion be given *equal weight*
- when the personal interests are given more discussion time than the merits of a good idea
- when a lot of us go to meetings, task forces, projects, cross-functional teams, committees, over and over again, and we wonder is this really producing value?
- when individuals assist every meeting, conference call or mass email, just for the sake of loosing important time
**This is called "politics"** and it is how most of the world works: When **having the biggest or loudest posse is more important than achievement and progress.**

**shifts people and resources forward in order to achieve goals

**A balance of extroverts and introverts makes for a better team.**
While extroverts will grab your attention and showcase their abilities, you might need to search a little harder to spot the talented quiet types. But donâ€™t go too far the other way and ignore extroverts â€” a balance of complementary personalities is often the most effective mix.
**More dispersed teams often outperformed â€œco-locatedâ€ teams.**
most important factor in the success of a remote team : 
- having processes in place to make sure each member contributes fully
- adequate support and communication
- scheduling time for virtual camaraderie building, including chatting in an informal context
- be pragmatists and craft solutions that work
- the people involved need to be willing to work with each other
- **Differentiate between roles.**
who is in charge of what parts leads to productive work (delineating responsibilities at the start of a project gives everyone at the table direction and a sense of ownership)
- good communication solves a lot
I think creative conflict is the best development facilitator, don't you?
I particularly like the point of communicating outside of the formal meets and channel
- be disciplined and say no to wasteful collaboration
In my design team, we have many strong characters, and have been working very hard on balancing them out
- virtual teams can outperform face-to-face teams
- attached to every meeting, conference call and mass email youâ€™re exposed to an invisible price tag
- need to be much more disciplined about how to collaborate
they are all developing themselves along the way
- leaders need to scrutinize, they need to prune collaboration
- breeding false confidence
when we work with others to reach a decision, we become overly confident in the accuracy of our collective thinking. The confidence boost we gain from working in teams can feel exhilarating in the short term. But it also clouds our judgment. We become dismissive of outside information which prevents us from making the best choices.
- laziness
Ever been to a meeting where youâ€™re the only one prepared? Then youâ€™ve probably experienced [social loafing](http://psycnet.apa.org/?&fa=main.doiLanding&doi=10.1037/0022-3514.65.4.681)â€”peopleâ€™s tendency to invest less effort when theyâ€™re part of a team. When others are present, itâ€™s easy for everyone to assume someone else will take the lead.
- pressures to conform
Within many team collaborations, we face an impossible decision: choosing between the quality of our work and the quality of our workplace relationships. Studies show that [group members tend to conform toward the majority view](https://adobe99u.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/asch1956.pdf), even in cases when they know the majority view is wrong.

synthesis doesnâ€™t necessarily requires harmony
a whole can be made up of fragmented parts
both culture and synthesis should be thought of as verbs rather than nouns, as a way of accounting for what has been done in and around an organization, as a way of making sense of what has been experienced.
Collaboration is working together to create something new in support of a shared vision. The key points are that it is not through individual effort, something new is created, and that the glue is the shared vision. The **art** of working with others
Foundational requirements for **collaboration :**
- humility : realizing that I donâ€™t know everything
- respect for the opinions and perspectives of others
- trust
exchange information, change activities, share their resources and enhance capacity for mutual benefit and a common purpose by sharing risks, rewards and responsibilities.
Coordination is sharing information and resources so that each party can accomplish their part in support of a mutual objective. It is about teamwork in implementation. Not creating something new.
Cooperation is important in networks where individuals exchange relevant information and resources in support of each otherâ€™s goals, rather than a shared goal. Something new may be achieved as a result, but it arises from the individual, not from a collective team effort.
Contribution: Something given or offered that adds to a larger whole.

+ **Fostering** CONTRIBUTION and Activism (**Teamwork)**
Creating, enhancing, and celebrating teamwork is at the heart of every successful company culture. A culture of teamwork focuses on team accomplishments rather than on individual accomplishments, encourages collaboration, and allows for tasks to be completed in a faster, better, and more efficient manner. One of the most common misconceptions about teamwork is that the success of a team is based on the personalities of the team members. The truth is that while personalities that work well together certainly make teamwork easier, the real success or failure of teamwork is derived from structure. Teams need to know what the expectations are and what the roles and rules are. Those need to be reinforced and clarified to all team members, and once this structure is in place, teamwork becomes much easier.
**Embracing diversity**
Cultural sensitivity is the awareness of practices and cultures that are different from your own. A culture that embraces diversity has an awareness of different cultures, of how these cultures should be properly approached, and how to communicate with them accordingly. Leaders and team members evaluate how certain cultural differences affect how people work, communicate, and interact without judging, making assumptions, discriminating, or stereotyping.
A company culture that embraces diversity is centered on tolerance and acceptance of others, which fosters teamwork and a general sense of collaboration.
**Positivity Optimism with doubts**
+ **Ability to have a voice in decisions**
keep highly creative and skilled individuals engaged
+ **Ability to take risk and be safe if fail**
creative individuals need room to be adventurous. To put it another way, they need permission to fail
**Honesty & Sincerity & Assertiveness & Altruism & Gratitude**
**Find teammates who do something you canâ€™t.**
McCartney excelled at melody, Lennon at lyrics. His songs were uplifting, Lennonâ€™s had an edge. McCartney was left-handed and, importantly, Lennon was not. Playing together, they each benefited from seeing a songâ€™s chord progression reflected back at them, making it easier to improvise notes that fit the scale.
The lesson: Collaborations are most effective when teammates complement rather than replicate one anotherâ€™s abilities. Skill duplication leads to power struggles.
complementing each other's skills rather than duplicating them rang especially true with me
**Insist on homework.**
McCartney and Lennon are thought of as a songwriting team, but the truth is they conceived of their songs alone. They collaborated after they had gotten a piece as far as they could, and were ready for suggestions. Most of the heavy creative lifting happens when weâ€™re by ourselves, working on our own. Weâ€™re in a better position to evaluate the merits of an idea after weâ€™ve given a topic some thought, not when encountering it for the first time.
The lesson: Use meeting time to exchange ideas, not generate them.
Collaboration is only successful when each person can feel like they serve a purpose, the minute a person's ego is destroyed because they're no longer the person in charge of that thing their contributions to the project / company dwindle. That is the reality.
many contributors are motivated by the idea that people are watching
It is important to emphasise that the contributions are voluntarily provided with the knowledge that the platform is open and observable. This does not mean Internet users want their activities and private communications to be monitored.
**There Are Too Many People**
Youâ€™ve probably heard the phrase too many cooks in the kitchen. A large team is often a hindrance to collaboration. Instead of helping, people talk over one another or go in circles debating a solution that no one can agree on. Not to mention, meetings can pose an efficiency challenge. Research from [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2016/01/collaborative-overload) found that 20 to 30 percent of value-added collaborations come from just 3 to 5 percent of employees.
**Get it on track:** With fewer people at the table, you can focus on who actually needs to be involved, who will offer the greatest value, and who can focus on other projects. â€œOrganize subdivisions and activities that are, at most, a multiple of 3. These mini-teams of 3 create a context in which each team member gets to share their point of view,â€ suggest collaboration experts at [Hubgets](https://www.hubgets.com/blog/introverts-extroverts-teamwork/).
**Employees Are Social Loafing**
Collaboration is a great way of using collective knowledge to create greater output and be more efficient. Unfortunately, this collective knowledge sharing can cause quiet or disengaged employees to rely on co-workers: â€œEver been to a meeting where youâ€™re the only one prepared? Then youâ€™ve experienced social loafingâ€”peopleâ€™s tendency to invest less effort when theyâ€™re part of a team. When others are present, itâ€™s easy for everyone to assume someone else will take the lead,â€ explains Ron Friedman.
This is annoying for co-workers who have to share the credit for their hard work with those who arenâ€™t participating. And it negates the value of collaboration, where a shared group of voices comes together to find a solution.
**Get it on track:** No one wants to be micromanaged, and company leaders donâ€™t want to spend their time babysitting employees. There are a few ways to handle social loafing:
- Create an anonymous tip box, where employees can share observations about fellow co-workers not participating in collaborative meetings. Team leaders can work with that person to get them, and future collaborations, back on track.
- Create a role of â€œcollaboration team lead.â€ That person is responsible for getting everyoneâ€™s input, ensuring that everyone is participating as much as possible.
**Thereâ€™s Too Much Groupthink Happening**
Collective knowledge sharing can also lead to â€œgroupthink,â€ which is defined on [BusinessDictionary.com](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/group-think.html) as the â€œtendency of the members of a group to yield to the desire for a consensus or unanimity at the cost of considering alternative courses of action.â€
This can cause poor decision making and lack of creativity: â€œWhen your best people reach a decision as a group, they can easily become overconfident with the results based entirely on the approbation of the group. This can have a quelling effect on creativity, leading those with better ideas to pipe down in service of keeping the group happy,â€ explains [Ilya Pozin](https://www.inc.com/ilya-pozin/why-collaboration-often-fails.html), founder of Pluto TV.
**Get it on track:** To ensure the best outcomes, start the collaboration with individual brainstorming, allowing employees to come up with their own fleshed-out ideas before getting into a room with 10 other people. This may boost confidence among collaborators who are now able to come to the table with an idea that they feel good about.
At the start of the meeting, everyone puts their idea on a sticky note (or whichever medium is most appropriate) and shares their resources and findings one by one. This allows the entire group to hear everyoneâ€™s ideas first, before collaboration starts.
Collaboration is a great way to get the most out of the brilliant thinkers in your office, but it can go off course quickly and easily. Diagnose the issue within your organization and then use these ideas to steer group sessions back on course. With a few simple tweaks, youâ€™ll be back to having productive collaborations in no time.
**Effective teams depend on â€œsocial sensitivity.â€**
Research has shown that the â€œcollective intelligenceâ€ of teams (as judged by their ability to perform well across a range of challenges) is based not on the average IQ of individual team members, but on the way team members take turns during conversations, and having a higher proportion of women in the group (see points 6 and 9).
[The research led by Anita Woolley](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/330/6004/686) suggests we should road-test our teams for these characteristics â€” known as â€œsocial sensitivityâ€ â€” just like we assess individuals. If a team flops at this assessment, then adjust the personnel to find a better mix, or train the team in better communication.
**Switch roles**
It's easy to become complacent when workers always take on the same role on every team and in every brainstorming session. To get your teams out of the box and spur innovation, encourage employees to take on new roles they find challenging.
As noted, you can't become a master at anything unless you tackle a big challenge headfirst. Ask your workers never to become happy with "good enough," and to fight the status quo. This will stop your teams from sleepwalking through their collaborative projects, and will cut down on social loafing.
**Play devil's advocate**
Is the brilliant idea your team came up with actually brilliant? Elect one person on the team to play devil's advocate and question the decisions of the team. Just by electing one person to ask the tough questions, your team will be forced to consider new perspectives, defend their position, and make sure any brainstorm can actually stand up to scrutiny.
**Put together a balanced team**
Don't fill a team with employees who all perform the same role. These workers are likely to think in a similar fashion, reducing the odds of coming up with truly creative solutions to problems. Instead, put together a team with a variety of skills, and ensure each team member has a dedicated and clear-cut role. This way, your team will take ownership of their specific tasks, further reducing social loafing.
**Allow for alone time**
Alone time in necessary for creativity. This is why many classrooms are adopting a flipped classroom model, where students come into the classroom having already familiarized themselves with the material. If workers have already done part of the work solo, they'll have better ideas of the challenges on the horizon, and will have more specific questions and advice to seek from the group.
Collaboration isn't a magical cure-all. But this doesn't mean that your business should do away with collaboration altogether. By clarifying roles, allowing for alone time, and avoiding groupthink, your collaboration can be more effective and help employees do their best work.
**The best teams communicate outside of formal meetings.**
[Researchers at MITâ€™s Human Dynamics Laboratory have found](http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/03/the_new_science_of_building_gr.html) conversations outside of formal meetings are the most important factor that contributes to team success. Their research showed that the energy and engagement of these informal interactions accounts for one third of the differences in productivity between groups.
There are simple steps we can take to increase these valuable encounters, including scheduling coffee breaks so that all team members get to chat with each other and planning social events. Related to this, the most productive creative teams are those that strike the perfect balance between â€œexplorationâ€ and â€œengagementâ€ â€“ sourcing new ideas from outside the team and integrating ideas within the team.
**Thereâ€™s a danger of teams splitting into sub-groups.**
Itâ€™s inevitable that allegiances and friendships will form within teams. [Research with space crews and arctic explorers](http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm?volumeID=24&editionID=201&ArticleID=1778) has shown how these â€œmicro-culturesâ€ can be particularly strong when theyâ€™re based on forms of social identity â€“ such as ethnicity or gender â€“ that predate the creation of the team. For multi-disciplinary teams, these divisions can also form along shared professional identities.
[A study led by psychologist Doris Fay](http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.co.uk/2006/12/what-makes-multidisciplinary-team-work.html) investigated this problem in the UKâ€™s healthcare system. Fay found that diversity was a bonus â€“ multi-disciplinary teams produced better quality innovations than more homogeneous teams â€“ but only if certain processes were in place to help prevent internal splits. These included making sure all team members were committed to the same cause; ensuring everyone felt listened to; the team reflected on its own performance; and there was plenty of communication between team members (see point 9).
**Companies with at least one woman on their boards tended to be the strongest performers.**
**Teams perform better when they include both men and women.**
In 2012, [Credit Suisse published an analysis](https://infocus.credit-suisse.com/app/article/index.cfm?fuseaction=OpenArticle&aoid=360157&lang=EN) of nearly 2,400 international companies, finding that those with at least one woman on their boards tended to be the strongest performers. The benefits of having both men and women in the controlling team were especially apparent in tougher operating conditions and was attributed by the report authors to issues such as better team diversity (see point 5) and a balance of leadership skills.
Whatâ€™s the optimum gender balance to aim for? [An experiment published in 2011](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1826024) by European researchers found that teams of business students with a 50-50 mix of men and women performed best at a business venture game. The researchers said this was at least partly due to mixed-gender groups engaging in more â€œmutual monitoringâ€ â€“ making sure everyone pulled their weight for the teamâ€™s benefit.
**Most good teams have one analytic thinker on board.**
Team members with a big picture thinking style are great for brainstorming and creative problem solving but when it comes to idea execution a study published this year suggests itâ€™s a good idea to have at least one focused, analytic thinker on your team â€” that is, someone who can focus on the details of your project.
Ishani Aggarwal and Anita Woolley at the Tepper School of Business [found that teams with an analytic thinker tended to perform better](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074959781300054X#) on â€œexecution tasksâ€ because they paid more attention to â€œprocess focusâ€ â€“ identifying sub-tasks and the resources needed to complete them. Aggarwal and Tepper warned this benefit needs to be balanced as big picture thinkers and analytical thinkers can disagree on strategic priorities, harming team performance. To avoid this, foster a team-wide appreciation of process focus and get team members to agree explicitly on strategic priorities. Recruiting a rare individual with a mixed cognitive style (big picture and analytic) can also help foster communication between team members with different thinking styles.


The number of people I get to interact with in this company is probably about 50 on a regular basis. Maybe 100. And one of the things that I've always felt is that most things in life, if you get something twice as good as average you're doing phenomenally well. Usually the best is about 30% better than average. Two to one's a big delta. But hat became really clear to me in my work life was that, for instance, [Steve] Woz[niak] was 25 to 50 times better than average. And I found that there were these incredibly great people at doing certain things, and you couldn't replace one of these people with 50 average people. They could just do stuff that no number of average people could do. [...]. And so I have spent my work life trying to find and recruit and retain and work with these kind of people. My #1 job here at Apple is to make sure that the top 100 people are A+ players. And everything else will take care of itself.

Collaboration NEEDS Coordination

Leaders can help their teams by doing the following:
- Communicate the effect of task switching on productivity and mental well-being.
- Practice asynchronous communication in your company (make it okay to not respond to things immediately and instead respond at a time that suits you).
- Encourage or mandate that people turn off all notifications.
- Allow people to schedule windows of two to four hours for deep work.
- Clearly delineate between what is urgent and whatâ€™s not.
- Create spaces where people canâ€™t be physically interrupted (or [encourage remote work](https://hbr.org/2014/01/to-raise-productivity-let-more-employees-work-from-home)).
- Reward team members for less screen time.
- Set windows of time for when internal meetings will take place, and windows of time where no meetings should occur.
