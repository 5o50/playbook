Control The money
===

Do not reveal how much you're making or how much people are making relative to one another. Its none of their business. I normally fund in cash one of my administrators with a lot of cash and he pays everyone by sending them cash in the mail, or bitcoins. He makes comptability records and bring them to me so i can see where the money went, before I handle more cash/btc to him.
