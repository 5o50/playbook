T Shaped Persons

The beauty of a T-shaped is really you don’t need a lot of bureaucracy and a lot of systems to get people to collaborate. 

T-shaped people have a huge benefit, and that is that they can deliver two kinds of performances: their own individual job, and by working with others. 

They’re disciplined enough to say, yes to great collaboration project and no to another and they can deliver on it. So it sort of takes care of itself.

# do his own job really well

- the salesperson goes out and delivers every quarter
- the product developer who does the work really well

So at IDEO they have people with different disciplines, people with different strengths.

It might be somebody really good at industrial design, architect, mechanical engineer, or graphic designer. 

That’s the deep skill set you need to do a job really well. That’s a vertical stroke of the t metaphor, if you will, to think about that letter.

But that is not enough. You also need a horizontal stroke of a T, which is that 

# have disposition for collaboration, for teamwork, having the right attitude, and being able to work with others.

- you need to know enough about what they do
- you need to have empathy, that is to be able to put yourself in their shoes

And when you have that, you have a person who is a much more well-rounded– they have a deep expertise, they can do their job, and they also have this ability to work with others.

If you can cultivate T-shaped people in your company, what you’re getting is people who can do that by themselves.
