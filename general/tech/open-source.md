# Open Source
There are three different categories of functions you might consider putting into libraries:
1. Stuff worth reusing for everyone.
2. Stuff only worth reusing for your organization.
3. Stuff not worth reusing.
Category one is something for which a standard libraryÂ *should*Â exist, but for some reason nobody got around making one (or did someone? Did you search thoroughly?). In that case consider making your library open source. Sharing your work doesn't just help others, it also helps you, because you will receive bug reports and patches from other users. When you doubt that anybody would contribute to your library, then you might be dealing with functionality which is actually category 2 or 3.
The second category are things you need over and over again, but nobody else in the world needs it. For example, the implementation of the obscure network protocol to communicate with your inhouse-developed backend system. In that case it might make sense to put that stuff into an inhouse library to improve development speed of new applications. Just make sure it doesn't get too much affected by feature creep and starts to contain stuff which actually fits into categories 1 or 3. Additionally, the advise by Blrfl regarding modularization is very good: Do not create one monolithic Conor Corp. Library. Create multiple separate libraries for separate functionalities.
Category three is functionality which is either so trivial to implement that moving it to a library isn't worth it or where you aren't sure you will ever need it again in exactly that form in another application. This functionality should stay part of the application it got developed for. When in doubt, it likely belongs into this category.

Open Source Challenges

- **Apple**. The open source community has won its long war against Microsoft. Redmond declared its "love" for Linux and made many openÂ [source-friendly moves](http://thevarguy.com/open-source-application-software-companies/microsofts-linux-and-open-source-moves-look-back#slide-0-field_images-92211)Â in recent years. But that other major consumer computing company -- Apple -- remains considerably less in love with open source (which is ironic, given that macOS is built in part on open code derived from BSD). Sure, Apple publishesÂ [some open source code](https://opensource.apple.com/). But most of Apple's products and platforms are super-proprietary and closed. (Case in point: Facetime, which is so proprietary you can't talk to people with non-Apple devices.) As long as Apple looms as a highly successful closed-source software company, open source will face stiff competition in the consumer market.
