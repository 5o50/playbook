Art Programming

Program interactive sensible experiences.

Program interactive experience that touch the suffering of the subject

Programming simulates symbolism (VR ? Music ? Blockchain ?) touches the sensible world

Programs that express some sensibility, visually, soundly, or in any form.

That could be considered as work of art.

The existence of so many restraints in the actual practice of code writing makes it tempting to dismiss programming as art, but when you think about it, people who create recognized art have constraints too. Writers, painters, and so on all have their code--writers must be comprehensible in some sort of way in their chosen language. Musicians have tools of expression in scales, harmonies, and timbres. Painters might seem to be free of this, but cultural rules exist, as they do for the other categories. An artist can break rules in an inspired way and receive the highest praise for it--but sometimes only after they've been dead for a long time.

When done right, art and craft blends seamlessly. That's the view of several schools of design, though of course not the view of people into "art as provocation".

Define "craft"; define "art". The crafts and arts that I appreciate blend seamlessly into each other so that there is no dilemma.
