UNDERSTAND BEFORE SHOOTING AN ARROW

DONT CUT COGNITION!!! its about them not you. RETURN QUESTIONS. Never agree nor disagree with anything someone says until you fully understand them.


Think twice: Think fast, and slow.

Thinking, Fast and Slow, points out that taking the time to think slowly in addition to our typical fast thinking can help.

He believes we have two minds at work:

the fast mind that makes snap judgments and the slow mind which is deliberate in its thinking and looks deeper into issues. 4 Try this little exercise to use both your fast and slow mind.

Ask yourself a question like, “Who is the most famous singer in the world?” Undoubtedly, your fast mind will jump in and make a snap decision to come up with an answer like Madonna, Michael Jackson, or Freddy Mercury.

Once you have your snap answer, try to move beyond that. Ask yourself, “Who is the third-most famous singer in the world?” Now your slow and deliberate thinking mind will be activated as you dig deeper.

Keeping both minds at work will only serve to help you as you try to gather a more complete and accurate picture and make the most informed decision possible.

Using your slow mind is the cure of availability heuristic because this practice is exactly about not using your gut-judgment and easily accessible ideas.
