Wishful Thinking

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishful_thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishful_thinking)

In addition to being a [cognitive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias) and a poor way of [making decisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making), wishful thinking is commonly held to be a specific [informal fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_fallacy) in an argument when it is assumed that because we wish something to be true or false, it isactually true or false. This fallacy has the form "I wish that P is true/false, therefore P is true/false."[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishful_thinking#cite_note-7) Wishful thinking, if this were true, would rely upon [appeals to emotion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_emotion), and would also be a [red herring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring_(fallacy)).[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)]

Wishful thinking may cause blindness to [unintended consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences).[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)]
