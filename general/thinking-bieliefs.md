We sometimes believe in things just because we need to believe in them and not because they are real things. If a certain belief is required in order for a person to feel good then this person might believe in it, even if it was wrong, just to feel better.

People develop certain beliefs in order to maintain their psychological stability.

Any threat to that belief is considered a threat to the person's psychological stability.

The person doesn't just believe in a lie but he also defends it strongly because he won't be able to handle the psychological pressure that he will go through if he admitted that he was wrong.

It's much easier for a person to believe a lie when he is controlled by emotions such as fear or anxiety.
