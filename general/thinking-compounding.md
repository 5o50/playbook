is what can give you anything is life

changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if youâ€™re willing to stick with them for years.

Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.


Long term habit change is NEVER the result of a strong willpower.
Long term results are always, ALWAYS equal to your self image.
