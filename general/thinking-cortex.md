“When the brain builds a model of the world, everything has a location relative to everything else,” Mr. Hawkins said. “That is how it understands everything.”

“The cortex knows the location of everything,” Mr. Hawkins said. Mr. Ahmad had no idea what he was talking about.

As Mr. Hawkins looked at that cup, he decided that cortical columns did
not just capture sensations. They captured the location of those
sensations. They captured the world in three dimensions rather than two. Everything was seen in relation to what was around it.
