Half True

I have a really hard time when anyone says anything even slightly off putting or sounding like a half-truth. Immediately my brain gets suspicious and I assume that not only is someone lying to me, but that it is specifically with malicious intent.

E.g. Not responding to my messages for hours but I see that they’re active on social media/online during this time? “Oh no I am being ignored and they hate me.”

I know that thinking like this is entirely irrational and when I can I try to rationalize things, since it’s never as bad as it seems. But because of past experiences I just can’t seem to turn it off. I hate being a paranoid person. I don’t want to push people away with constant unwarranted anxiety.

You sound very insecure, you should work on your self image; don’t rely on other people to be happy, create your own happiness from yourself. Make yourself the center of attention for yourself, see other people as a pit stop for you and nothing else. Read up on stoicism

That’s very true. I need to stop relying on people so much. It’s hard for me because I am so extroverted, but there’s a difference between spending time with people and depending on them for my happiness.
