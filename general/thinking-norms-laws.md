**Norms & Laws**

**Changing Norms and Beliefs**

Different cultures have different norms, even if they share other types of practices and beliefs. 

It is also true that norms change over time within a given culture. 

Two obvious examples here are hairstyles and clothing styles. 

When the Beatles first became popular in the early 1960s, their hair barely covered their ears, but parents of teenagers back then were aghast at how they looked.

If anything, clothing styles change even more often than hairstyles.

Hemlines go up, hemlines go down. 

Lapels become wider, lapels become narrower. 

This color is in, that color is out. 

Hold on to your out-of-style clothes long enough, and eventually they may well end up back in style.

Cultures differ widely in their norms, or standards and expectations for behaving.

We already saw that the nature of drunken behavior depends on society’s expectations of how people should behave when drunk. Norms of drunken behavior influence how we behave when we drink too much.

Norms are often divided into two types, **formal norms** and **informal norms**.

Formal **norms**, also called mores (MOOR-ayz) and laws, refer to the standards of behavior considered the most important in any society.

Examples in the United States include traffic laws, criminal codes, and, in a college context, student behavior codes addressing such things as cheating and hate speech. Informal norms, also called folkways and customs, refer to standards of behavior that are considered less important but still influence how we behave.

Table manners are a common example of informal norms, as are such everyday behaviors as how we interact with a cashier and how we ride in an elevator.

Many norms differ dramatically from one culture to the next. Some of the best evidence for cultural variation in norms comes from the study of sexual behavior (Edgerton, 1976).

Other evidence for cultural variation in norms comes from the study of how men and women are expected to behave in various societies.
