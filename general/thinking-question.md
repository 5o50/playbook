👀 ne te détourne pas des contradictions, questione ta division

**How to Ask valuable Questions**

1. A valuable question is energizing. It’s an inviting challenge, it’s something that’s interesting and fun to pursue. It inspires a new way of seeing things, a new way of ordering information.
2. A valuable question is an act of pointing. First you survey the ideascape in front of you – maybe it’s shared territory between the two of you, or maybe it’s you looking over your conversation-partner’s shoulder – and then you try and identify the most compelling, interesting thing, and point to that.
3. “Funny” or “interesting” is a sort of compass or gyroscope that guides you away from stale questions.

ask yourself es ce que ce que tu penses de quelqun est basé sur des facts ? quelle est votre relation ? votre deal ? respect ou pas ?

learn how to ask powerful questions (about facts or opinions for a specific "group")

je pose la bonne question

**It means you don't know how to ask a question properly, in order to get an answer that will satisfy you.**

**real eyes, realise, real lies.**

don't look with the past, remove the contradiction, by accepting what is and empowering and not what should be

REMOVE CONFLICT

If you want to bring order and make end to conflicts focus on the fact without the past/the ideal/emotions/the what should be, look at what is, without judging. See the contradictions and untie it. Go through it. There lies truth.

be meaningful about you, don’t be blind

void = blind — feel yourself, you already know

face your own question and find conclusions

don’t fall in traps and fears, think love and confidence

**Resolve conflict and build team unity**

Have you ever been part of a team so great that you love coming to work? Teams like this probably do all or most of the above – work assignments are clear and processes make sense, deadlines are ambitious but fair, and feedback is plentiful – but they also do something more. On these teams, it’s not just the boss motivating team members — the expectations of peer team members are powerful motivators, too. Creating this kind of team culture is an important element of good execution. While there’s a lot that goes into building high-performance teams, in our experience, perhaps the biggest single thing for leaders to focus on is resolving conflict. That’s because many of the problems within a team come from differences and conflict between team members; on high-performing teams, team members trust each other and conflict is constructive, not destructive or personal.

As you think about your ability to execute we feel that all four of these dimensions are critical. You may focus on one or two and find that one is lacking. But our research shows that balancing all four of these factors is the strategy that will improve execution most of all.

Finally, if you’ve made it this far and you really feel like you’re already doing all of these things, and yet somehow you’re still perceived as having an “execution problem,” consider this: in our research, we also found that there’s almost a one-to-one relationship between leaders who are seen as fast, and those who are seen as great executors. [Previous work we’ve done](https://hbr.org/2015/02/you-have-to-be-fast-to-be-seen-as-a-great-leader) has shown that some of the above things – setting stretch goals, having clear processes in place, and building trust, for example – will help you move faster. But you may also need to give your peers and bosses more evidence of your speed by, for example, being more transparent about how many projects you’re working on and where they are in your pipeline.
