Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin Lefevre

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reminiscences_of_a_Stock_Operator

assume the market is composed of two individuals, the buyer and the seller. these two individuals are the average of all market participants on both sides holding a net long or short position

this is a simplification that works, assuming you are aware of the varying timeframes that participants will be trading on

**Trade History**

The right side shows a history of all recent trades. Each trade has a size, price, timestamp, and direction (buy or sell). A trade is a match between two parties, a taker and a maker. More on that below.

**Trading Strategy Metrics**

When developing trading algorithms, what do you optimize for? The obvious answer is profit, but that’s not the whole story. You also need to compare your trading strategy to baselines, and compare its risk and volatility to other investments. Here are a few of the most basic metrics that traders are using.

- **Net PnL (Net Profit and Loss)**

Simply how much money an algorithm makes (positive) or loses (negative) over some period of time, minus the trading fees.

- **Alpha and Beta**

[Alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_(finance)) defines how much better, in terms of profit, your strategy is when compared to an alternative, relatively risk-free, investment, like a government bond. Even if your strategy is profitable, you could be better off investing in a risk-free alternative. [Beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_(finance)) is closely related, and tells you how volatile your strategy is compared to the market. For example, a beta of 0.5 means that your investment moves $1 when the market moves $2.

- **Sharpe Ratio**

The [Sharpe Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio#Use_in_finance) measures the excess return per unit of risk you are taking. It’s basically your return on capital over the standard deviation, adjusted for risk. Thus, the higher the better. It takes into account both the volatility of your strategy, as well as an alternative risk-free investment.

- **Maximum Drawdown**

The [Maximum Drawdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawdown_(economics)) is the maximum difference between a local maximum and the subsequent local minimum, another measure of risk. For example, a maximum drawdown of 50% means that you lose 50% of your capital at some point. You then need to make a 100% return to get back to your original amount of capital. Clearly, a lower maximum drawdown is better.

- **Value at Risk (VaR)**

[Value at Risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_at_risk) is a risk metric that quantifies how much capital you may lose over a given time frame with some probability, assuming normal market conditions. For example, a 1-day 5% VaR of 10% means that there is a 5% chance that you may lose more than 10% of an investment within a day.
