**Trading**

The Trading Pocket is your ultimate manager of fear versus greed. This pocket fluctuates depending on whether you are greedy or panicking and feel the urgent need to convert at least some of your holdings to cash. The amount in this pocket should only be what you could afford to lose as often people concentrate their positions.

Do It Yourself

You can access a

diversified portfolio of US Stocks

international stocks

and fixed income through Vanguard funds.

You will need to setup a monthly deposit plan

with your broker to take advantage of dollar cost averaging so that you do well over your entire investment cycle. Moreover, Vanguard funds have a low expense of about 0.16% which would take care of your transaction costs and help you increase your returns

The major Discount Brokers

Schwab, Fidelity

Have trained representatives in their offices that don’t mind talking to customer that are not large enough for full service investment advisors. They won’t make formal recommendations, but at least they can guide you in how to put together a portfolio.

Online advisors, sometimes called also “robo advisors,

like Betterment and Wealthfront allows you automatic rebalancing for tax loss harvesting and customized financial planning to understand your investment goals. The total expense with Robo advisors could be 0.4-0.5% of your invested amount. Some of these online advisors also give you the ability to talk to an advisor on the phone if you need further assistance.

Trickle Invest

An individual investor can’t go much wrong with passive investing, especially if they “Trickle Invest”.

Trickle Investing means that each year, you only invest a small portion. You don’t suddenly throw all your money into the markets. And then when you retire, you only take out a small portion each year. That way, you completely eliminate any timing risk as your investing and withdrawing is spread across so many years. Your returns increase with compounding and with low cost, diversified, indexed, passive investments, which allow you to grow your investments and earn the best return possible for a given level of risk.

**Personal Finance**

I'm very excited for you. You're 20 years old. When I was 20 I was busy saving money that I would end up losing. When I was 22 I was thrown out of graduate school and then fired from 3 jobs in a row at higher and higher salaries where I saved nothing.

When I was 24 I moved to NYC and began the first of about ten career changes.

In that time I made a lot of money. Then lost a lot. Then made a lot. Then lost a lot. Then made a lot more.

I did this so many times I made a study of what was working for me on the way up. And what wasn't working on the way down.

So I'm not an expert on anything. I just know what has worked for me to create massive success.

First off, don't bother saving money. You get more money in the bank by making more money. That's rule #1.

Buying coffee on the street instead of in a Starbucks is the poor man's way to get rich. In other words, you will never get rich by scratching out ten cents from your dollar.

People save 10 cents on a coffee and then....overpay $100,000 for a house and then do reconstruction on it.

Or they save 10 cents on a book and then...buy a college degree that they never use for $200,000.

Now your real education can begin:

A) Don't save money. Make more. If you think this is not so easy then when you walk in a certain direction then eventually you will get there.

B) That said, don't spend money on the biggest expenses in life. House and college. Just saving on these two things alone is worth over a million dollars in your bank account.

C) But doesn't renting flush money down the toilet? No, it doesn't. Do the math. You can argue all you want but the math is very clear as long as you are not lying to yourself.

D) Haven't studies shown that college graduates make more money 20 years later?

No, studies have not shown that. They show correlation but not causation and they don't take into account multi-collinearity (it could be that the children of middle class families have higher paying jobs later and, oh by the way, these children also go to college).

E) Don't invest in anything that you can't directly control every aspect of. In other words...yourself. You can't make or save money from a salary.

And salaries have been going down versus inflation for 40 years. So don't count on a salary. You're 20, please take this advice alone if you take any advice at all.

F) If you want to make money you have to learn the following skills. None of these skills are taught in college. I'm not saying college is awful. I'm just saying that the only skills needed to make money will never be learned in college:

- how to sell (both in a presentation and via copywriting)

- how to negotiate (which means win-win, not war)

- creativity (take out a pad, write down a list of ideas, every day)

- leadership (give more to others than you expect back for yourself)

- networking (a corollary of leadership)

- how to live by themes instead of goals (goals will fail you)

- reinvention (which will happen repeatedly throughout a life)

- idea sex (get good at coming up with ideas. Then combine them. Master the intersection)

- the 1% rule (every week try to get better 1% physically, emotionally, mentally)

- "the google rule" - give constantly to the people in your network. The value of your network increase linearly if you get to know more people but EXPONENTIALLY if you and the people you know, get to know and help each other.

- how to fail so that a failure turns into a beginning

- simple tools to increase productivity

- how to master a field. You can't learn this in school with each "field" being regimented into equal 50 minute periods. Mastery begins when formal education ends. Find the topic that sets your heart on fire. Then combust.

- stopping the noise: news, advice books, fees upon fees in almost every area of life. Create your own noise instead of falling in line with the others.

If you do all this you will gradually make more and more money and help more and more people. At least, I've seen it happen for me and for others.

I hope this doesn't sound arrogant. I've messed up too much by not following the above advice.

Don't plagiarize the lives of your parents, your peers, your teachers, your colleagues, your bosses.

Create your own life.

I wish I were you because if you follow the above, then you will most likely end up doing what you love and getting massively rich and helping many others.

I didn't do that when I was 20. But now, at 46, I'm really grateful I follow the above rules.

**TL;DR:** "In the short term, the market is a voting machine. But, in the long term, the market is a weighing machine". -- Ben Graham[1]

Part 1: How the stock market works

Part 2: How does one evaluate Stocks

**Part 1: Basics of a Stock Market**

**History:** A long time ago, humans ran businesses with just their money. The businesses they ran were small and they grew the businesses only with their own profits. However, not all businesses can be built with your own money. What if you wanted to build a new factory that costs more than a million dollars? Banks won't lend money for young companies and your friends won't have that much.

In the 15th-16th century as the Europeans started exploring Asia and Americas, the big explorers felt they needed a lot of money and their kings were not providing them anymore. The wealthy guys demanded a lot of interest. Thus, they felt mmthey need to raise money from a bunch of common people. Thus, in 1602, the Dutch East Indian company became the first company to issue shares of its company in the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and get traded on a continuous basis.

**What is a Stock?** Stocks in a company provide you a share of the company's future profits in return for the capital invested. For instance, if you buy 1 stock of Apple now, you will be assured one-billionth of Apple's profits in the future (as there are almost a billion such stocks that Apple has issued now).

**Listing:** In a stock market, 1000s of companies are listed and these companies (called public companies - as they have given out their shares to common public) pay a fee to the exchanges, along with a promise to provide all important info to the markets. In return they get an opportunity to put their company in the stock market's board & have the ability to get money from people visiting the market. The first time a company's stock appears on the stock market's board is called an **IPO (Initial Public Offer)**.

**Brokers:** Conceptually, a stock exchange is similar to eBay. These guys allow companies to be listed and connect the buyers & sellers. Since millions of people trade in the market and it is practically impossible for these exchanges to deal with all the individuals, they have assigned brokers who act between the exchanges and the individuals.

**Part 2: How does one value a stock**

**Basic Terminology:**

We will use a term **EPS (Earnings per share)** that is exactly as it sounds. It is the profits of the company divided by number of shares. For instance, Apple has $41 billion in profits and about 950 million shares, giving an EPS of about 41000/950 = $44/share. Thus, if you own a share of Apple, you are entitled to 44 bucks of Apple's profits this year.

**Calculating Share price:**

To evaluate how much you need to pay for that 1 Apple stock you need to do a simple addition of all the earnings you will get

**Stock Price = EPS in Year 1 + EPS in Year 2 +...**

Now, you know that a dollar earned 10 years from now is not the same as a dollar earned now. Because, there is an interest rate **i** involved and money you get in 10 years is less worthy than the money you have now. Thus, you need to adjust that formulae.

**Stock Price = ((EPS in Year 1)/(1+i))+ (EPS in Year 2/(1+i)^2) +...**

Now, there is a whole bunch of math involved (starting from the compound interest formula) and for the sake of simplicity, I will get you to the final results and reduce the stock price to two cases:

**1. In case of a mature company that doesn't grow:**

**Stock price = EPS/Interest rate**

The expected Interest rate is relatively easy to calculate and depends on how risky the company is, how risky the market is and the current long term interest rate of government bonds. For many mature utility companies this interest rate comes to about 10%. Thus, utility companies that doesn't grow much is generally traded at about 10-15 times the EPS. (insert in the formula above).

The stock prices of these companies are very smooth and change only when there is a change in long term interest rates, the risk profile of the company (can change when hurricanes such as Sandy hits) or when market risk changes (for instance 2008 financial crisis). But on a regular day, not much action here. Let us move to the second category of shares:

**2. For a growing company:**

**Stock price = EPS of next year / (interest rate - expected growth rate of the company)**

Let us use a simple example. If you assume Apple's next year EPS will be $48, the expected interest rate for such a risky company at 15% and an expected annual growth rate at 5%, you will get:

$48/(15%-5%) or $48/10% or $480 as the ideal stock price for the company. Where did I get this magical 5% number?

**Getting the growth inputs:**

Now, we need to find the growth rate of the company and figure out what the company will earn in the next year, the following year and so on. This is not an exact science and no one has a perfect answer to this question. This is why we need stock markets. Collectively, we all pool our intelligence to figure out the future growth of the company and thereby its current price.

To do this collective prediction, we constantly get new inputs and project that to future. For instance, if the company management gets hotshot new engineers, then we predict the future will be bright. What are the other news that investors typically use:

1. Periodic financial results of the company that gives us a view into the company;s workings and its financial position
2. Periodic results of similar companies that helps us guess this company;s results. Thus, when Apple sneezes everyone else catches a cold.
3. Changes in the sector. If a new report comes that people are more inclined to using mobile phones, we predict growth of these companies will be high.
4. Changes in the broader market.
5. Changes in the international economy

**Market Estimation:**

In short, we try to use every possible information to guess the future growth of the company, plug that into our formula and find out the stock price. For instance, if Apple comes out a report saying people are buying less of iPads, we might ding Samsung too as we believe their Galaxy Tabs will sell less too.

Estimating growth rate is an art rather than a science, and is collectively done by millions of humans in a place called the stock market. Since, we need to constantly adjust the growth rate based on new information, stock prices constantly fluctuate.

**Main advantages of a stock market:**

1. **Starting/building a business:** The market lets companies get money from a large number of people. That means there are more options to get money to build a business.

2. **Spreading risk:** It lets you spread the risk of a business into a large number of people. Since, each person is investing only a small portion of their income in the stock of a particular company, the risk of a single company collapsing doesn't significantly affect investors.

3. **Collective estimation of value**.

**Summary:** Modern corporations require a lot of capital, which is beyond the reaches of a few individuals. Markets help companies raise money from a large number of people and together these investors value their company. The theory is that when a large number of people do their independent valuation, the company's price comes more closer to its ideal worth.

"In the short term, the market is a voting machine. But, in the long term, the market is a weighing machine". -- Buffett

(Disclaimer: This is an answer targeted at basic-intermediate level investor & not high frequency traders or experts. I deliberately approximated a few things to improve clarity).

[1] [Buffett's metric says it's time to buy](http://money.cnn.com/2009/02/04/magazines/fortune/buffett_metric.fortune/index.htm)

[Balaji Viswanathan's answer to What should everyone know about investing?](https://www.quora.com/What-should-everyone-know-about-investing/answer/Balaji-Viswanathan-2)

[Balaji Viswanathan's answer to What should everyone know about economics?](https://www.quora.com/What-should-everyone-know-about-economics/answer/Balaji-Viswanathan-2)

You can think of a stock as equity in a business. As opposed to debt, equity doesn't need to be paid back. Equity can be defined as an ownership claim on a business.

You can think of the stock market as a **crowd** of people, composed of buyers and sellers trying to come to an agreement as to what the correct price of a stock should be. Each time a trade occurs, a buyer with the highest bid buys from a seller with the lowest offer.

Stock prices go up when buyers buy stock aggressively (hitting offers, lifting bids). And stocks prices go down when sellers sell aggressively (hitting bids, lowering offers).

Stocks clearly out perform all other asset classes over the long run:

Now I find stocks to be a very funny thing because paradoxically no asset class creates more wealth than stocks and yet the average stock investor doesn't even come close to the returns stocks offer.

Here is how the average investor performs relative to other asset classes:

The average investor even under performs inflation, so net they lose money.

Now, how does one reconcile this paradox? So for an investor to get the full return stocks offer, he should just buy a low cost index fund and hold it forever right?

But even that doesn't seem as easy as it sounds because stocks have **insane volatility.**

For example the Dow Jones currently (1/29/15) sits at 17,400.

In 2014, the Dow fell 9,956 points on down days. And it rose 11,202 points on up days.

In the past six years the Dow fell **55,962** points on down days. And it rose**67,029** points on up days.

The average person simply cannot stomach this kind of volatility even if invested passively in index funds.

So what accounts for all of this volatility? Are moves in prices actually driven by underlying volatility in earnings? It doesn't seem so. Earnings, especially when normalized, are remarkably stable compared to price. So the thing that drives price is really the madness of crowd behavior. Robert Shiller won a Noble for his research on this.

Another thing about index funds: They buy stocks regardless of valuation. Index funds assume everyone is rational, and markets are efficient, and all stocks are perfectly priced. So when the entire index becomes massively overvalued, this can happen to an index fund:

Even indexes can lose over 80% net inflation and it can take decades to recover. The Nikkei still hasn't recovered its high water mark 25 years later.

Mike Tyson probably wasn't thinking of markets when he said "Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face." But that's exactly what volatility does to an investor's plan for his portfolio.

I have yet to even talk about the numerous thinking errors and biases everyhealthy mind falls victim to. You can read more about that here:

[List of cognitive biases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)

One of the greatest geniuses ever, Isaac Newton said: “I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies but not the madness of people.” He said that after he blew his fortune in the market. His investment experience looked somewhat like this:

Fidelity did a study on whom amongst their brokerage customers had the best returns. And they found the most hilarious answer: the people that forgot they had a brokerage account. They either bought stocks or inherited them decades ago and forgot all about them. They had the highest returns. The miracle of compounding takes decades to show its immense power. Warren Buffet earned **95%** of his wealth **after** he turned 65. Successful investing is not a get rich quick scheme but rather a life-long marathon.

You may think you can avoid the difficulty of investing in the market and simply find a great investment adviser or hedge fund manager to invest your money for you. But even the vast majority professional investors underperform passive indexing after expense deductions.

Extremely skilled advisers and hedge fund managers do exist but have zerointerest in your money unless you have millions to invest or you have billions to invest as a sovereign wealth fund.

A person only has a chance at building wealth in stocks if they see it as buying businesses. Read 5 years worth of 10ks before investing a penny. Make sure you understand the business. Stick to high quality businesses with reasonable valuations. Avoid timing the market but remember downside momentum can be very powerful. Value, Quality, and Momentum are the three factors that generate the highest returns.

If you prefer to invest in indexes instead, then I advise using the CAPE (cyclically adjusted price-earnings) ratio to avoid bubbles.

I find the stock market to be a very funny place. In theory it creates immense wealth. But in practice, the human mind seems incapable of being patient fordecades, and not following the herd of investors that chase after bubbles. The market is not for the faint of heart but "faint heart never won fair lady."

The average investor does not do well at investing. Based on comprehensive work of Richard Bernstein Advisors, if you look at asset class performance between 1992 and 2012 then even inflation has outperformed an average investor by 0.1%. In summary, all investments, even cash, have elements of risk. It is hard for an individual investor to understand those risks, especially the subtle or indirect risks.

Why does an average investor underperform everything, here are a few likely reasons:

**The game has changed:** About 2/3rd of trading in the US is dominated by high frequency algorithm trades and ETFs. Active investing industry is a shrinking industry where even professional investors with an army of highly trained analysts find it hard to beat the market on consistent basis. Although, each one of us thinks that she is an excellent investor, the reality or results tell a different story. The major reason is market timing. Most individual investors do not get the timing right, largely because of lack of a disciplined process, and greed and fear. When most renowned investors like Howard Marks, Warren Buffet, and many others shy away from market timing commentaries in public, it is hard to imagine that an individual investor with a laptop and online brokerage account can call market top and bottoms with ease.

Most investors are hindsight futurists. I often heard “I knew it” exclamations after the fact. In my long career in investment management, I might have seen 2-3 real good market timers and even they would have a 50-60% strike rate.

Most investors follow their emotions when it comes to getting in or coming out of an investment. I still meet investors who have made the emotion mistake. What I learned throughout the years is that understanding one’s true, long-term horizon and sticking to a basic plan are critical to growing your assets safely.

**Forget to differentiate between saving, investing, and trading:** Most people might use some of these terms interchangeably but there is a huge fundamental difference among these terms. I once asked a retail investor about how long does he keep his positions and he answered about less than a year and he still call himself an investor. In my dictionary, anything that is kept for less than a year is simply trading.

**Transaction costs:** Too much of trading and portfolio turnover add to your costs, decrease your returns, and make your broker rich. Just to give you some perspective on how transaction costs can eat your performance, I would quote results from Barber and Odean study on performance on individual investors over long term horizon. They collected a total sample of about 65,000 investors between 1991 and 1996; the 20 % of investors who traded a lot earned an annual return net of trading costs of 11.4 % while buy-and-hold investors earned 18.5 % net of costs, a significant difference of 7% per year.

**Diversification:** “Of course, you have to diversify!” However, lack of diversification remains among the biggest mistakes I still see being made by even the “sophisticated” investors. The idea of diversification may be easy to understand, but too many times I have observed it is not easy for people to follow, even when they have been properly instructed.

So now you know why people lose money in the market, let us try to figure out how people can do better investing, by which I mean not losing money.
