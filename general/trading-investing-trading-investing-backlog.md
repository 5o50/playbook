## Trading Wisdom & Market Quotes
- "As well, when bearish patterns fail, they can produce extremely quick and powerful bullish moves"
- "The best follow through out of an ascending or descending triangle does not take place towards the apex of the triangle, it takes place about 2/3 of the way from the left side to the apex. This is classical Edwards and McGee technical analysis 101"
- "It had become evident toward the end of the month that the bears just didn't have enough firepower to push the market below that big support level"

## Whale Analysis Examples
- Coffee Shop Analogy for Whale Detection:
  "Imagine that you are looking to understand if there is any whale activity at your local coffee shop... If someone comes along and orders 100 lattes, that would get your attention--you have spotted a whale! What if, however, someone was ordering 5 lattes, and then getting in the back of the line again..."
