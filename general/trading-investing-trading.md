Keep your AMMO for the Big Show fuckin noob !!
the best advice i got so far is from @khonsu - i lost 90% of my stack on margin. he said ‘we get one shot at this. dont lose your ammo being a greedy fucking idiot or trying to get rich quickly.’ i was pretty ready to quit crypto altogether at my portfolios all time low.

All of the winners have a buy in above $100 per share. All of the most traded have a buy in below $20 per share.

AMZN $1370

AAPL $170

FB $190

NVDA $230 (even last year it was ~110)

TSLA $340

Compare that with:

AMD $12 (two years ago it was $2)

FIT $5

SNAP $14

GPRO $6

F $11

If you only have $200 in your account, you don’t think you can afford to buy Facebook and Apple, but you know for sure you can afford AMD and Ford.

Price per share is a very big factor for why people are buying the “losers”.
