Chart patterns are a very popular way to trade any kind of markets because the most profitable chart patterns give us a visual representation of the supply and demand forces.

If weâ€™re on the supply and demand topic we recommend studying more this subject here: [Supply and Demand Trading-Learn about Market Movement](http://www.tradingstrategyguides.com/supply-and-demand-trading/).

What makes chart patterns so appealing is that it also brings to light what happens behind the scene aka the buying and selling pressure.

If you remove all your indicators from the charts and everything else that might make your chart less clear and just look at the price action, whether itâ€™s 5-minute chart, daily chart or whatever itâ€™s your preferred time frame youâ€™ll actually gain more insights into what actually happens in the market.

As long as the candlesticks have the variable open, high, low and close; you can use them just to confirm your position or even entering a new trade. You can build a really successful chart pattern trading strategy without the need of any other technical indicator.

There are bullish and bearish chart patterns and what makes them work is that they tend to reoccur over time making it possible to backtest them and find their probability of success rate.
