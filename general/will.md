DO WITHOUT WILL, WITH JOY AND COMPASSION

REMOVE YOUR WILL, JUST BE

Do not try to fly. 

Look not for success or failure.

Join yourself to the perfectly unselfish will and work on.

Know that the mind which is born to succeed joins itself to a determined will and perseveres. You have the right to work, but do not become so degenerate as to look for results. Work incessantly, but see something behind the work. Even good deeds can find a man in great bondage. Therefore be not bound by good deeds or by desire for name and fame. Those who know this secret pass beyond this round of birth and death and become immortal.
