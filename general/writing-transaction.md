**You begin to understand that writing/reading is, above all, a transaction.**

**FIRST LOVE AND CARE ABOUT YOUR INTERLOCUTOR WITH EMPATHY**

CONTROL LANGUAGE— DON'T SAY EVERYTHING YOU THINK

The reader donates his time and attention, which are supremely valuable commodities. In return, you the writer must give him something worthy of his gift to you.”
