 There are tricks to provoke an applause. There are secret weapons to make your points stand out. Pay attention to TED talks and famous speeches and you'll notice patterns

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphorism

- **Technique of the 3 final elements**

    Caeser said . When wrapping up a speech, a sure way to get an applause is to finish with a triad. Imagine you were speaking to your team to motivate them for the next football match: "Guys, we'll step in this field and ,  and " *cheering*

    Veni, Vidi, Vici

    we'll work together

    suffer together

    WIN together

- **JFK Signature Move**

    One of the most famous quotes by JFK: "My fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country." A sure way of drawing an applause from an audience is to reverse a sentence like this. If you were doing a speech for fundraising event for your school: "Fellow colleagues, our school has done a lot for us; I trust that today, we'll do a lot for our school". *applause*

- **Spiral speech**

    A spiral speech is the one that is built around a sentence or idea. Take Martin Luther King, for example, his "I have a dream" speech was entirely built around that sentence. "I have a dream... I have a dream... I have a dream". It's a device of incredible rhetorical power.

---------------------------------------

The single most important piece of advice I ever got was to concentrate on story. What is "story" ? It's the quality that keeps the reader following the narrative. A good story makes interesting things happen to a character with whom the reader can identify. And it keeps them happening, so that the character progresses and grows in stature.

A writer's job is to do whatever is necessary to make the reader want to read the next line. That's what you're supposed to be thinking about when you're writing a story. Don't think about money, don't think about success; concentrate on the story--don't waste your energy on anything else. That all takes care of itself, if you've done your job as a writer. If you haven't done that, nothing helps.

Who am I writing for ?
===

**You are writing for yourself !**

Don't try to visualize the great mass audience — there is no such audience — every reader is a different person

Don't try to guess what sort of thing editors want to publish or what you think the country is in a mood to read — Editors and readers don't know what they want to read until they read it.

Besides, they're always looking for something new.

Don't worry whether the reader will "get it" if you indulge a sudden impulse for humor. If it amuses you in the act of writing primarly to please yourself, and if you go about it with enjoyment you will also entertain the readers who are worth writing for. If you lose the dullards back in the dust, you don't want them anyway.

This may seem to be a paradox. Earlier I warned that the reader is an impartient bird, perched on the thin edge of distraction.

DONT FEAR TO TELL TRUTH

BE TRUTH

Authenticity

Don’t use the voice of someone else

Write HARD and CLEAR about what HURTS.
===

Ernest Hemingway.

---

NE DICTE JAMAIS CE QUE LES AUTRES DOIVENT FAIRE OU CE QUES LA VERITE.
===

ONLY TALK SPECIFIC TO YOUR ACTION

ALWAYS TALK FOR YOU ONLY. BE SHORT, JUST, AND CLEAR, DON'T OVER JUSTIFY  AND NEVER ANGRY OR HELPLESS.

MAKE IT SHORT AND SWIFT, PRECISE WITHOUT JUDGMENT NOR CLICHE. NEW PERSPECTIVE, juste RIGHT


--

 ALWAYS TALK IN YOUR PERSPECTIVE
===

Find elegant solutions to your problems.

IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT YOU LIKE

OR DISLIKE WHEN YOUR TAKE A DECISIONS

ASK YOURSELF WHAT IS RIGHT ? BASED IS YOUR PERCEPTION RIGHT ?

FOLLOW INTUITION TO RIGHT ACTIONS

IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT HURTS OR GIVE PLEASURE.

BUT WHAT IS RIGHT/TRUE.

GET WHAT YOU WANT

ASK SPECIFICALLY

[The Ultimate Guide to Writing Online — David Perell](https://www.perell.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-online)


**the person who can formulate and communicate the best argument almost always wins.**

**If you sharpen your capacity to think and to communicate as a consequence of writing, you are better armed.**

**writing extends your memory, facilitates editing and clarifies your thinking**.

**You can write down more than you can easily remember, your capacity to consider a number of ideas at the same time is broadened.** 

**you can move ideas around and change them, word by word, sentence by sentence, and paragraph by paragraph.** 

**You can reject ideas that appear substandard, after you consider them more carefully. If you reject substandard ideas, then all that you will have left will be good ideas.** 

**you will have good, original ideas at your fingertips, and you will be able to organize and communicate them.**

**competence**

**productivity**

**security**

**originality**

**engagement** 

**Ideas change the world, particularly when they are written.** 

**The pen is mightier than the sword**

> Vigorous writing is **concise**. A **sentence** should contain **no unnecessary words**, a paragraph **no unnecessary sentences**, for the same reason that a **drawing** should have **no unnecessary lines** and a machine **no unnecessary parts**; This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outlines, but that **every word tell**.

elementary rules of composition

- make the paragraph the unit of composition: one paragraph to each topic
- begin each paragraph with a topic sentence, end it in conformity with the beginning
- use the active voice
- put statement in positive form
- omit needless words
- avoid a succession of loose sentences
- express co-ordinate ideas in similar form
- keep related work together
- in summaries, keep to one tense
- place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end

The primary reason to write an essay is so that the writer can formulate and organize an informed, coherent and sophisticated set of ideas about something important.


## Prepare
Why → How → What

story delivery (format + distribution)

story theme development

construction of sentences and paragraphs

choice of words

### Writing Process
- Idea + Headline + keywords (5 minutes)
- Research + structure (30 minutes)
- Write without distraction, editing or images (4 hours)
- Edit and add images
- Add meta data and (optimize for SEO) (15 minutes)

### Message Map — Pitch anything in 15 sec (simple, clear and concise)
1 - Create a twitter friendly headline : The one overarching message that you want to communicate to your customer. The one thing you want people to know.

2 - Add 3 supporting points related to the main message

3 - You can add bulletpoints to each of these supporting points: be very specific, data, example, stories




### THE TOPIC

**THE TOPIC AND THE READING LIST**

The central question that you are trying to answer with the essay is the topic question. 

Very general, abstract topics sound philosophical. Good topics do not have to be so general.

**THE OUTLINE**

ENTER TOPIC HERE

When you write your first draft, it should be longer than the final version. 

This is so that you have some extra writing to throw away. You want to have something to throw away after the first draft so that you only have to keep what is good. It is NOT faster to try to write exactly as many words as you need when you first sit down to write. Trying to do so merely makes you too aware of what you are writing. This concern will slow you down. Aim at producing a first draft that is 25% longer than the final draft is supposed to be. If your final work is to be 1000 words, then write that (or four pages) below. The word document will automatically add 25% to the length you specify.

Now specify the length of your essay.

Now you have to write an outline. This is the most difficult part of writing an essay, and it’s not

optional. The outline of an essay is like the skeleton of a body. It provides its fundamental form and structure. Furthermore, the outline is basically the argument (with the sentences themselves and the words serving that argument).

A thousand-word essay requires a ten-sentence outline. However, the fundamental outline of an essay should not get much longer than fifteen sentences, even if the essay is several thousand words or more in length. This is because it is difficult to keep an argument of more than that length in mind at one time so that you can assess the quality of its structure. So, write a ten to fifteen sentence outline of your essay, and if it is longer than a thousand words, then make sub- outlines for each primary outline sentence. Here is an example of a good simple outline:

Topic: Who was Abraham Lincoln?
Why is Abraham Lincoln worthy of remembrance? What were the crucial events of his childhood?
Of his adolescence?
Of his young adulthood?

WORDS:

PAGES:

ADD 25% TO THE ABOVE LENGTHS

• • • • •

How did he enter politics?
What were his major challenges?
What were the primary political and economic issues of his time? Who were his enemies?
How did he deal with them?
What were his major accomplishments?
How did he die?

Here is an example of a good longer outline (for a three thousand word essay):

Topic: What is capitalism?
How has capitalism been defined?

o Author 1

o o

•

•

o

•

•

•

o

• • • • • • •

• •

Author 2

Author 3
Where and when did capitalism develop?

o Country 1

o Country 2
How did capitalism develop in the first 50 years after its origin?

o How did capitalism develop in the second 50 years after its origin?

(Repeat as necessary) Historical precursors?

o (choose as many centuries as necessary) Advantages of capitalism?

o Wealth generation
o Technological advancement o Personal freedom

Disadvantages of capitalism?

Unequal distribution

o Pollution and other externalized costs Alternatives to capitalism?

o Fascism

o Communism
Consequences of these alternatives? Potential future developments? Conclusion

Beware of the tendency to write trite, repetitive and clichéd introductions and conclusions. It is often useful to write a stock intro (what is the purpose of this essay? How is it going to proceed?) and a stock conclusion (How did this essay proceed? What was its purpose?) but they should usually then be thrown away. Write your outline here. Try for one outline heading per 100 words of essay length. You can add subdivisions, as in the example regarding capitalism, above.

Write outline here:
1. Outline sentence 1:
2. Outline sentence 2:
3. Outline sentence 3:
4. Outline sentence 4:
5. Outline sentence 5:
6. Outline sentence 6:
7. Outline sentence 7:
8. Outline sentence 8:
9. Outline sentence 9:
10. Outline sentence 10 (repeat if necessary):

**PART EIGHT: GENERATING A NEW OUTLINE**

So now you should have produced a pretty decent second draft. You have identified the appropriate sources, written the proper notes, outlined your argument, roughed in a first draft (paragraph by paragraph), rewritten your sentences to make them more elegant, and re-ordered those sentences, as well as the paragraphs themselves. This is much farther than most writers ever get. You may even think you’re finished – but you’re not.

The next step will take you from a “B” essay to an “A” essay. It may even help you write something that is better than you have ever produced (better meaning richer in information, precise, coherent, elegant and beautiful). Copy what you have written so far here:

FULL RE-ORDERED ESSAY HERE:

Read it. Then go to the next page.

This part of the process will probably strike you as unnecessary, or annoying, or both, but what do you know? This is the step that separates the men from the boys, or the women from the boys, or the men from the girls, or whatever version of this saying is acceptably non-sexist and politically correct.

You have just finished reading your essay. Try now to write a new outline of ten to fifteen sentences. **Don’t look back at your essay while you are doing this.** If you have to, go back and re-read the whole thing, and then return to this page, but don’t look at your essay while you are rewriting the outline. If you force yourself to reconstruct your argument from memory, you will likely improve it. Generally, when you remember something, you simplify it, while retaining most of what is important. Thus, your memory can serve as a filter, removing what is useless and preserving and organizing what is vital. What you are doing now is distilling what you have written to its essence.

Write new outline here:
1. New outline sentence 1:
2. New outline sentence 2:
3. New outline sentence 3:
4. New outline sentence 4:
5. New outline sentence 5:
6. New outline sentence 6:
7. New outline sentence 7:
8. New outline sentence 8:
9. New outline sentence 9:
10. New outline sentence 10 (repeat if necessary):

Now that you have a new outline, you can cut and paste material from your previous essay. To do this, open up a new Word document beside this one. Then cut and paste the new outline that you have written into the new Word document. Return to the original document, and scroll up to the full, re-ordered essay you copied and pasted into Part Eight, above. Then cut and paste from the re-ordered essay into your new outline.

You may find that you don’t need everything you wrote before. Don’t be afraid to throw unnecessary material away. You are trying to get rid of what is substandard, and leave only what is necessary.

Once you have finished cutting and pasting your old material into the new outline, then copy the new essay, and paste it into a new word document. That will be your final essay. Don’t forget to put a title page on it.

**PART NINE: REPEAT**

Now you have a third draft, and it’s probably pretty good. If you really want to take it to the next level, then you can repeat the process of sentence rewriting and re-ordering, as well as paragraph re-ordering and re-outlining. Often it is a good idea to wait a few days to do this, so that you can look at what you have produced with fresh eyes. Then you will be able to see what you have written, instead of seeing what you think you wrote (which is the case when you try to edit immediately after producing).

You are not genuinely finished until you cannot edit so that your essay improves. Generally, you can tell if this has happened when you try to rewrite a sentence (or a paragraph) and you are not sure that the new version is an improvement over the original.
