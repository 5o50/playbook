> We’re going from computers with cameras, that take photos, to computers with eyes, that can see - Benedict Evans

**Vision Mode — WHAT DO I SEE ?**

First screen camera scan

**cognition ken burns effect focus or multitask**

Really, this is another incarnation of the image sensor as input rather than camera - you don't type or say 'chair' or take a photo of the chair - you show the computer the chair. So, again, you remove layers of abstraction, and you change what you have to tell the computer - just as you don't have to tell if where you are. So it's not, really, a camera, taking photos - it's more like an eye, that can see. ‘a computer should 'never ask the user for any information that it can autodetect, copy, or deduce’
