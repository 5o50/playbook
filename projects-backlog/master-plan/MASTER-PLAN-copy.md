I'll help you break down a strategic plan to reach your goal of €50,000/month through digital products and services. Here's a suggested addition to your MASTER-PLAN.md:

Some important considerations:

1. **Start Small**: Don't try to build everything at once. Pick one project and make it successful before expanding.

2. **Validate Ideas**: Before building anything, validate your ideas through market research and minimum viable products (MVPs).

3. **Focus on Automation**: From the beginning, implement systems that can scale without requiring your constant attention.

4. **Build an Audience**: Start building an audience early through content marketing, social media, and email lists.

5. **Diversify Revenue**: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Multiple revenue streams provide stability.

6. **Reinvest Profits**: In the early stages, reinvest most profits to accelerate growth.

7. **Quality First**: Focus on creating high-quality products that solve real problems. This leads to better retention and word-of-mouth marketing.

Remember that reaching €50,000/month is a significant goal that typically takes several years of consistent effort. Start with smaller milestones (e.g., first €1,000/month, then €5,000/month) and scale up gradually.
