Is there some dictionary of chemistries that smell of certain things?
I assume there’s no baguette in the smell. It’s just something that sufficiently tricks the nose combined with a graphic and an expectation.
So if I wanted to make something smell like X could I look up the chemical recipe for that?

Often times, you can research the chemical composition of odors by searching for its name plus GCMS.
The Good Scent Company is a free online database of natural materials, pure aromachemicals, and formulae.
Issues of the trade rag Perfumer & Flavorist are available for free online and there will be content about GCMS, chemistry, and formulating.
Basenotes is a forum for amateur perfumery that may have relevant conversation.
And there are the manufacturers of chemicals used in fragrance and flavors: Givaudan, IFF, Firmenich, Symrise, and others. Their catalogues and the vendors that sell them (some even in small quantities) can be valuable resources just for exploring the space.

They can give you the basic recipe, but the full formula varies from application to application. Some molecules won't stand acid, or soap, or heat, so you need to work around it. It's rarely just one or two molecules, except in extremely cheap things, and it will need dozens of support flavors to get the right result.
The specifics are closely guarded secrets, because of the weird way the industry pays for research and manufacture.
