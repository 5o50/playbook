ya til un media entre une tele et un ordinateur, ou c'est un ecran non tactile de 15 pouces max à 2 à 5 metre de distance de son utilisateur controlé principalement par les mouvement des bras et de la main et eventuellement par la voie. il affiche principalement de l'information sans son de maniere plus passive qu'une télé et avec un controle plus intuitif et simplifié qu un ordinateur ou un smartphone

Il n'existe pas actuellement de média grand public qui corresponde exactement à votre description, mais certaines technologies émergentes s'en rapprochent. Voici une analyse des éléments les plus proches de votre concept :

## Écrans intelligents et assistants vocaux

Les écrans intelligents comme l'Amazon Echo Show ou le Google Nest Hub s'approchent de votre idée. Ils offrent :

- Des écrans non tactiles d'environ 10 pouces
- Un contrôle vocal et parfois gestuel
- Un affichage passif d'informations

Cependant, ils sont généralement utilisés à plus courte distance et ont des écrans plus petits que ce que vous envisagez.

## Technologie de contrôle gestuel

Des systèmes comme le Leap Motion ou les caméras de profondeur permettent un contrôle par les mouvements des bras et des mains. Toutefois, ces technologies ne sont pas encore largement intégrées dans des produits grand public pour le salon.

## Écrans d'information ambiante

Certains concepts d'écrans d'information ambiante, comme des miroirs intelligents ou des cadres numériques avancés, correspondent à l'idée d'affichage passif d'informations. Néanmoins, ils manquent généralement de capacités de contrôle gestuel sophistiqué.

## Conclusion

Bien qu'il n'existe pas de produit commercial répondant précisément à tous vos critères, la combinaison de technologies existantes pourrait potentiellement créer un tel appareil. Il s'agirait d'un hybride entre :

- Un écran intelligent de grande taille (15 pouces ou plus)
- Un système de contrôle gestuel avancé
- Un assistant vocal
- Un logiciel d'affichage d'informations ambiant

Ce concept pourrait combler le fossé entre la télévision traditionnelle et l'ordinateur, offrant une expérience d'information plus passive et intuitive dans un espace de vie.
