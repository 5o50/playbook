- 1960's or earlier science textbooks -- Yes they may be out of date, but I find that they have much more practical examples and are more applicable to "garage" scientists.

In General I recommend that you camp out in your local libraries Science and Technical Section, comb the stacks and just start pulling stuff that looks interestin
