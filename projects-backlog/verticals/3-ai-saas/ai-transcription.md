# AI Transcription

## Background & Analysis

AI transcription has become a very useful tool in a variety of industries: education, journalism, customer service, healthcare, and more.

The AI-powered speech-to-text market was already valued at nearly $2 billion in 2022. By 2032, it’s predicted to hit $18.67 billion. That’s a CAGR of more than 25%.

The appeal of AI transcription lies in its speed and accuracy. 

It takes a human transcriber approximately 5-7 hours to transcribe a 60-minute meeting, but AI tools transcribe in real-time. And, they can be up to 99% accurate. 

Because of this, AI transcription costs about 70% less than human transcription.

Company leaders at Otter, one of the most popular AI transcription services, say their tool has been used to transcribe more than 1 billion meetings since launching in 2016.
