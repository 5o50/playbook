## Background & Analysis

Travel eSIMs allow users to access local cell networks so they can easily use data while visiting another country. 

This saves users the hassle of physically swapping out SIM cards, paying expensive roaming fees, or signing up for costly plans from their carrier. 

Travel eSIMs are available for purchase online or via mobile apps, and they often come at an affordable price. They can be activated in a matter of minutes.

Research shows that the average mobile subscriber pays $8.57 per GB of data when their phone is roaming. Alternatively, travel eSIMs charge an average of $5.50 per GB.

40 million individuals across the globe are predicted to use travel eSIMs in 2024. By 2028, that number is predicted to grow to 215 million.

Airalo, one of the most popular eSIM marketplaces, claims to have over 5 million users to date.
