I want to build a mobile-first app, accessible on web and mobile, that answers best someone search intention.

I believe when someone is looking for something, they have an intention about a topic.

This intention can be to get more information about a topic, or to get a compairison of products, services or ideas about a topic or finally to make a transaction about a topic.

I'd like my app to be able to bring this person the fastest and quickest from a spark in their mind to the best answer they can get using :
- a multimedia approach to enhance information absorption with proven mediums and techniques like LLMs, short videos, and custom ui like maps, lists, cards.
- a social (human-curated answers) approach to enhance information absorption with proven mediums and techniques like nano-influencers, ephemeral video showcases, AI-generated demo clips + voiceovers, neighborhood-based group buying, TikTok Shop API integration.

To ensure safety of transactions, I'd like to build a verified partner network instead of open crawling the web.

I'm not looking to replace google for search, but focus on decision-support rather than search.
