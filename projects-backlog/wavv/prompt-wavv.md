Okay, the user wants a recap of all the criteria we discussed for naming their app, formatted into a prompt they can reuse. Let me start by going through our previous conversations to extract the key points.

First, the name needed to be globally accessible, especially considering European languages, with simplicity in spelling and pronunciation. They emphasized avoiding complex or region-specific sounds. Then, it had to clearly signal a social or messaging app, making the purpose obvious without explanation. The user wanted something original and not generic, avoiding overused terms. Incorporating a French essence without alienating non-French speakers was crucial, so bilingual roots were important.

The name should be verb-ready, allowing users to say things like "Wave me" naturally. Memorable mouthfeel with hard consonants and rhythmic sounds was another point. They preferred short names, around 4-5 letters, for ease of recall and typing. Cultural neutrality was key to avoid unintended meanings, and domain availability with a .com or relevant TLD was necessary. Additionally, built-in metaphors related to connection or communication, like "wave," added depth. Lastly, the name needed to stand out in app store searches and feel urgent or action-oriented.

Putting this all together into a structured prompt that encapsulates each criterion clearly. The prompt should guide future name generation to meet all these points without missing any aspects the user highlighted. Making sure each part of the prompt addresses the specific needs they mentioned, like avoiding being too French-centric yet having a French touch, ensuring verb potential, and checking domain availability. The example using "Wavv" helps illustrate how the criteria apply in practice. Double-checking that all discussed elements are included to make the prompt comprehensive and useful for the user's future endeavors.
