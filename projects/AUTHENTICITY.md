It has to be imperfect to be real.

Authenticity is imperfect by definition. The more you try to polish, the more you try to make what you publish perfect, the less people are drawn to you because it doesn’t sound real. 

It sounds like something that’s been worked on, reworked, and reworked again… so it loses all its charm.

This is also a concept you can find in the art of dressing well. 

There’s this Italian concept that, in my opinion, is so beautiful to explore and study, called sprezzatura. Essentially, sprezzatura is about looking effortless, without really being effortless. 

It’s about looking beautiful while seeming unkempt.

And this is exactly what your content should look like. It should be imperfect while still being striking, sharp, visceral—something that touches people in their soul, not just their eyes. 

Many people try to optimize for readability and skimmability. But the truth is, if you really want to break through, if you want to become people’s hero—and that’s what you should aim for if you’re writing content—you need to incorporate elements of imperfection. 

It has to be imperfect to be beautiful. 
It has to be imperfect to be real.
