Tip: If a network own multiple sites in the same niche - like Static and their three food blogs - try to find commonlities betwen the type of content they're publishing. If something bings in a lot of clicks and / ior ranks easily on one site, they'll write the same kind of content for another one of their sites to take up more search result real estate.

You can find similar content each site is publishing by taking your time and clicking around manually or if you have access to a paid too like Ahrefs you cna use their content gap feature to see similar keywords they're targeting.

Just two of Static's food blogs share over 80,000 keywords in common in the US alone. A lot of these multiple rankings will not be accidental.
