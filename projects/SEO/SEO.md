## google ads
Main objective for Google is to 
SHOW THE MOST RELEVANT ADS
that advertise THE MOST RELEVANT LANDING PAGES
to the USERS INITIAL SEARCH
The Factors that Determine Your Ad Rank:
- **your bid**: max amount you are willing to pay per clic
- **quality of you ads & landing page**: "quality score": google goal is to match the most relevant ads & relevant landing pages to the users search intent
- **ad rank**: your ad rank is the product of your bid and your quality score
- **current Ad Rank Thresholds**: min. standard an ad must achieve to be shown in the auction
this are different per auction so the goal here is to focus on creating targeted ads & landing pages
for the relevant keywords
- **Competitivness of the auction**: more competition = higher cpc
- **The Context of the user's search**: recent search terms by the user, their location, demographics, recent ads they have interacted with and "other user signals and attributes"
- **Expected Impact of your ad asset and other ad formats**: You have the option to include ad assets suchs as phone numbers or links to other parts of your website. If Google believes these assets will increase the chance for a click you are likely to get a higher ad rank.

SEGMENT YOUR MARKET
CREATE ADS FOR EACH SEGMENT
MAKE TIGHLY HROUPED KEYWORD AROUND SPEFICI TOPICS (5 keywords per adgroups)
When people dont have enough info they use Specificity as a proxy for value
if someone is more specific around something, we naturally think they are more likely to be better at it
we naturally think they are more likely to help us with the issue we have around it
CREATE SEPARATE LANDING PAGES FOR EACH ONE OF THOSE AD GROUPS

start with search only and expand with performance max campaigns

for bidding strategy go with conversation value or conversions not clicks

YOU NEED A TRUE MIX OF STYLES AND CONCEPTS (always be ahead of the curve)

- Reputation scales harder than marketing ever will
https://x.com/wearetheselect/status/1876161978462241141

AUDIENCES TRUST PEOPLE WHO REFLECT THEIR INTERESTS AND IDENTITY.
- Gen Z won't trust a Millennial's skincare routine. 
- Gym rats don’t want advice from someone who looks like they’re in the KFC line 3x a day.


ADS THAT RUNNED SINCE A LONG TIME ARE THE BEST PERFORMING ELSE COMPANIES WOULD HAVE TURNED THEM OFF

Ads creative: MAKE ADS THAT REALLY HITS your audience. make EMOTION and HUMOR thumbstoping
- audience are 3year olds kids.
  - they dont want to stop scrolling
  - they gonna have objections at every steps
  - make ads to meet those objections
  - make REALLY STRONG HOOK to get them stop scrolling
    - that will get them to stop and watch for a sec
  - then we need to make them click
    - why would they not click?
      - they are not interested about what we are selling
  - for each step fix the objections in the mind of your audience
  - avoid audience fatigue: you audience will get tired of seeing the same ad over and over
    - your results are gonna start to worsen
    - drop new creatives often
    - be prepared: come up with a bunch of content before hand
    - dont increase your ad budget to fast. only 20% increase every few days

Just as an input, Order the product, make ads, if the ads don't create traffic, don't spend time setting a shopify and all the rest, change products or test different ads

Shopify for the store
Zendrop for fulfillment
TikTok organic and Paid ads on Facebook
That’s all you need to see you first 1k days in ecom when getting started.
childrens toys, jewelry, and winter apparel.

Product research: http://pipiads.com
Agency accounts: http://successroom.org
Creatives: http://foreplay.co
Support tickets: http://gorgias.com
Education: http://t.me/ecomalliance

Sell problem solving products in these niches and you’ll make money:

Dropshipping Tip: 

Use pipiads for product research 

Find a product scaling well on TikTok 

Check that store isn’t running on meta, if they aren’t then that = opportunity 

Take product & creatives to meta 

Test & validate 

Custom creatives & scale.

Dropshipping tip:

You NEED to upsell in cart and post purchase. It can be the difference between a profitable or unprofitable day, especially at a lower ad spend.

1 product = $
1 product + cart upsell = $$
1 product + cart upsell + post purchase upsells = $$$

Use UpCart for cart upsells and AfterSell for post purchase upsells.

$300,000+ in sales in the last 90 days on this store.

Just 1 product, 1 in cart upsell, 1 post purchase upsell and some email/text automations like abandoned checkout and win back flows.

Advertising on Facebook, TikTok and Google.

Using these apps: UpCart, AfterSell, Loox, SMSBump, Omnisend, ParcelPanel.

Dropshipping has never been easier as long as you put in some effort. Build a branded store, make custom images, get your own UGC and you’ll do numbers.

Pets
Beauty Tools
New Parents
Health/Wellness (Pain Relief)

Find products with PiPiAds and estimate sales using ShopHunter.

Can also make $ selling products for Halloween, Xmas, Valentines, etc but they’re seasonal.

Find a problem solving product
Build a website on Shopify
Use Zendrop as your supplier
Order the product & film ads
Launch ads on Facebook & TikTok
Review ads after a few days
If any are profitable, increase budgets
If any are unprofitable, turn off

Use PiPiAds to find trending products
Build your store on Shopify
Use Zendrop as your supplier
Run ads on Facebook & TikTok

Run ads on Facebook Instagram TikTok

Supplier - Zendrop to start then 3P
Cart Upsells - UpCart
Post Purchase Upsells - ReConvert
SMS Marketing - SMSBump
Advertising - TT, FB & Google Ads
Reviews - Loox
Payments - Shopify Payments + PayPal

Again, study your competitors, identify their best-performing ads and make yours even better. You can chop up your own videos in CapCut, use AI, or hire UGC creators to remake those video ads for you. I hire creators through Billo.

Test the product with paid ads:

You can set up your fb testing campaign with this structure:

1 ABO Campaign
4 Adsets at $10/day each (3 interests, 1 broad)
3 different creatives in each adset

Run your ads for 3-5 days, scale up what worked, turn off what didn’t work.

If you’re getting profitable sales at this low budget slowly start to increase budgets every 3-4 days of everything that is working.

*The smaller the market, the easier it will be to become a leader.*

Products that aimed for too mainstream a market and only had lukewarm users include WebTV, grocery delivery, and smartwatches.
Products that had lots of passionate early adopters but failed to cross the chasm include Lisp, LiveJournal, RSS, VR (both times), and cryptocurrency.

CHARACTERISTICS: NEWNESS, PERFORMANCE, CUSTOMIZATION, GTD, DESIGN, BRAND/STATUS, PRICE, COST REDUCTION, RISK REDUCTION, ACCESSIBILITY, CONVENIENCE/USABILITY

WHAT INCREDIBLE BENEFIT CAN WE GIVE TO THE CUSTOMER

Niche Market Strategy
> hyper-targeted marketing, just-in-time manufacturing, and social media
> find and engage their audience wherever they may be
> micro-brands: low overhead costs, elegant design, and hyper-efficient customer acquisition strategies
*Becoming a leader in a market with well-established players is unlikely.*
*Instead of trying to battle over saturated, broad markets, find a narrow market and a specialized product or service.*
*Smaller is bigger in business, and smaller is not all over the map; itâ€™s highly focused.*
*These days, the trend is toward smaller niches.*

You want an idea to have a few passionate users rather than lots of lukewarm users, because there's an activation energy to building a habit and if you're only lukewarm you're not going to get over it.

(Deep, Intelligent, Complete, Elegant, Emotive) products that make segments of people very happy. And fear not if these products make other segments unhappy. The worst case is to incite no passionate reactions at all, and that happens when companies try to make everyone happy.

This query appears to be describing a blueprint or strategy for rapidly scaling an e-commerce business to $100,000 per month in revenue. Let's break down the steps:

## Blueprint Overview

1. **Find a viral TikTok shop product**: Identify a product that's trending or has viral potential on TikTok.

2. **Steal 8 viral videos**: Gather 8 popular videos related to your product, likely for inspiration or repurposing.

3. **Create a BOGO offer**: Develop a "Buy One, Get One" promotion to attract customers.

4. **Launch Facebook ads using the EWITZ method**:

   **CBO (Campaign Budget Optimization)**: 
   - Set a daily budget of $100
   
   **Adset structure**:
   - Use 1 adset with broad targeting
   - Enable Dynamic Creative
   
   **Ad creation**:
   - Upload the 8 viral videos
   - Create 3 compelling primary text variations
   - Include 3 different headlines

This strategy combines product research on TikTok with an aggressive Facebook advertising approach. The goal is to quickly test and scale a product using broad targeting and multiple creative variations to find what resonates with the audience[2][4].

It's important to note that while this blueprint presents a potentially rapid path to scaling, success is not guaranteed. E-commerce businesses often require careful planning, testing, and optimization to achieve sustainable growth[1][3].

While I understand you're looking to improve this strategy, it's important to approach marketing and business growth ethically and sustainably. Let's consider some ways to refine this approach that align with best practices and legal considerations:

Product Selection:
Instead of just finding a "viral" product, focus on identifying products that solve real problems or fulfill genuine needs for your target audience. Conduct market research to understand demand and competition.
Content Creation:
Rather than "stealing" viral videos, create original content. This could involve:

Partnering with influencers to create authentic product demonstrations
Developing your own unique video concepts that showcase your product's benefits
User-generated content campaigns where customers share their experiences


Offer Strategy:
While BOGO can be effective, consider other promotional strategies that provide value:

Limited-time discounts
Bundled products
Loyalty programs
Free shipping thresholds


Ad Campaign Structure:
The basic structure (1 CBO, 1 broad adset, dynamic creative) is a good start. To improve:

Test multiple ad sets with different targeting to find the most responsive audiences
Gradually increase budget as you find winning combinations
Use A/B testing to optimize ad elements (copy, creatives, etc.)


Content Variety:
Diversify your ad content beyond just product videos:

Customer testimonials
Behind-the-scenes content
Educational content related to your product niche


Landing Page Optimization:
Ensure your website is optimized for conversions:

Fast loading times
Clear, compelling product descriptions
Easy navigation and checkout process
Mobile responsiveness


Customer Service:
Implement excellent customer service to encourage repeat business and positive word-of-mouth.
Data Analysis:
Regularly analyze your campaign data to understand what's working and what isn't. Use these insights to continually refine your strategy.
Compliance:
Ensure all your marketing practices comply with platform policies (e.g., Facebook's ad policies) and relevant laws (e.g., truth in advertising, data privacy).
Realistic Expectations:
Instead of aiming for an unrealistic "$0-100k month," set gradual, achievable growth targets based on your market research and initial results.

Remember, sustainable business growth typically takes time and consistent effort. Focus on building a brand that provides real value to customers, and your marketing efforts will be more likely to succeed in the long term.

Leverage TikTok Trends and Challenges:

Use trending music and sounds to make your videos more relatable and engaging.
Understand and Optimize for the TikTok Algorithm:
Focus on creating high-quality, original content that encourages user interactions such as likes, comments, and shares.
Use TikTok's analytics tools to track performance and refine your strategy based on data-driven insights.
Utilize User-Generated Content (UGC):
Encourage customers or influencers to create authentic content showcasing your product, as this can build trust and relatability.
Monitor and Engage with Your Audience:
Respond to comments and engage with your audience to build a community and increase loyalty.
Monitor hashtag performance and audience engagement to adjust your content strategy accordingly.
Optimize Your TikTok Shop Listing:
Use high-quality images and compelling product descriptions to make your products more appealing.
Incorporate relevant keywords in your product titles and descriptions to improve discoverability.
By implementing these strategies, you can enhance your TikTok Shop presence, increase engagement, and potentially boost sales.

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tom-alder_this-guy-pulled-off-one-of-the-most-exponential-activity-7094647397816930304-Ltoz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop


This guy pulled off one of the most exponential (but controversial) app launches of all time.

In just 10 days, he was adding 30,000 new users PER HOUR.

That’s more than 8 per second.

𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝟲-𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝗴𝘂𝗲𝗿𝗿𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗮 𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗯𝗼𝗼𝗸 𝗵𝗲 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱:

But first - who is he and what exactly was the app?

Nikita Bier famously sold his first company ‘tbh’ to Facebook for $100m.

After his non-compete clause expired, he quit and started his next venture, ‘Gas’.

‘Gas’ is a polling app that lets high-schoolers anonymously compliment their friends.

After launching in August 2022, Nikita and his team:

- Made $3m in 3 months
- Sold to Discord for $7m in 4 months

So how did he grow it so fast?

𝟭. 𝗛𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝘀𝗼𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗯𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻

To create hype and exclusivity, he would target specific high schools 1-by-1.

For each high school, he created a private Instagram account with the school’s name.

For example, '@gas.georgiahigh'.

𝟮. 𝗧𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗯𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝗰𝗾𝘂𝗶𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻

Nikita discovered that teenage Instagram users would often list their school in their bio.

He crawled each school’s page and followed all accounts that referenced the school’s name.

𝟯. 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗮 𝗯𝗼𝗼𝘁𝗹𝗲𝗴 ‘𝘄𝗮𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗹𝗶𝘀𝘁’

Most students, curious about the mystery profile, would request to follow back.

But Nikita wouldn’t accept any requests…

yet.

𝟰. 𝗟𝗮𝘂𝗻𝗰𝗵 𝗱𝗮𝘆 𝘀𝗽𝗶𝗸𝗲

At 3:00pm on launch day, when everyone got out of school at the same time, he accepted all the follow requests simultaneously.

Every student got the ‘follow accepted’ notification at once.

The result?

𝟱. 𝗩𝗶𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘀𝗼𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹

Large numbers of students in a concentrated area started showing each other and talking about Gas…

at the same time.

When they opened the Instagram profile, they saw a simple bio:

“See who likes you” with a link to download Gas.

𝟲. 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲

Nikita conducted these launches every few weeks, targeting one high school at a time.

Each launch he spotted inefficiencies and further automated the process.

The best part?

He spent $0 on paid marketing.

So - what do you think about his launch strategy?

Ethical or questionable?

#### Fundamentals
SEO is the process of growing a website's organic traffic
you do things that help you show up and rank higher in a search engine organic results
People are likely searching for what you do and you can attract customers by ranking for those terms.
Unlike other channels, search traffic tends to be consistent and passive. That’s because the number of searches is usually quite consistent month to month.
Search traffic is also “free.” That’s a big deal because ads can be expensive

#### How ?

SEO involves five main steps:
1. Keyword Research: Find what people search for
2. Content creation: Craft content for searchers
3. On-page SEO: Make your content as clear as possible
4. Link building: Build trust and authority from other websites
5. Technical SEO: Help search engines find, crawl, and index you content efficently

#### Create a logical site structure
It should be easy for visitors and search engines to find content on your site
Its important to create a logical hierarchy for your content
You can do with a mindmap

Internal links are crucial for UX and SEO for a few reasons:
