starting a new e-commerce company and you think it could make millions? Unless you test it with paid ads first (meaning before you do all the work) Make an AI mockup website, install hotjar add products that you don't stock yet and immediately refund customers. 
Use that data to open a real branded e-com store and crush it! Pro tip: Unless you choose an evergreen niche, just PPC the hell out of it, because SEO takes time. Double Pro Tip: Calculate $20-$50 per cost of sale, so simply stay away from low margin items, it's literally not worth it. With any sale you can expect chargebacks, loss of goods, customer support, returns, broken items, returned used items, additional shipping costs, and negative reviews. Selling a $20 t-shirt won't cover any of those costs, I don't care what any of those Youtubers told you!
