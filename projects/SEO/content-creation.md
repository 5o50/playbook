Quel type de contenu publier sur votre blog ?
Vous devez penser à la manière dont vous allez attirer votre audience (via les moteurs de recherche, les réseaux sociaux, des liens externes, etc.). On peut distinguer deux grandes familles de contenu :

Les sujets « chauds » qui couvrent l’actualité et les sujets tendance de votre secteur. 
Les contenus « froids », guide, tutoriel, dossiers thématiques, etc. 
Sur votre blog, variez les contenus froids et chauds, dans la mesure où votre secteur est bien sûr concerné. 


### Shorter Content (300-500 words): 
Suitable for product pages or specific queries where concise answers suffice.
product descriptions, homepages, or thin content. For example, in one study, the majority of websites (521 out of 751) had relatively low word counts

### Medium-Length Content (1,000-2,500 words):
Ideal for in-depth blog posts or articles targeting competitive keywords.
average word count for top-ranking pages on Google. For instance, the mean word count of a Google first-page result is 1,447 words. Many websites optimize for this range to balance depth and readability.

### Long-Form Content (3,000+ words):
Useful for comprehensive guides or topics requiring detailed explanations.
A smaller percentage of websites produce long-form content, but these pages tend to perform better in terms of backlinks, traffic, and engagement. Articles with 3,000+ words can generate up to 6.4x more traffic and 5x more backlinks compared to shorter content

While short content is abundant due to its ease of production, long-form content outperforms it in critical metrics like traffic, engagement, and authority, making it more effective for SEO and user satisfaction.

Exact percentages depend on the dataset analyzed, but studies consistently show that short content dominates in volume while long-form content excels in performance metrics.

Many websites prioritize creating a high number of pages with minimal content to target numerous keywords or topics, which contributes to its dominance in volume

Performance metrics are measurable indicators used to evaluate how well content performs in terms of user engagement, SEO rankings, and traffic generation.

Organic Traffic: Long-form content tends to attract more visitors over time due to its depth and relevance
Engagement Metrics: Users spend more time on pages with comprehensive content, leading to higher "time on site" and lower bounce rates
Backlinks: Long-form articles often earn more backlinks because they are seen as authoritative and valuable resources
Conversions: Detailed guides or articles can drive higher conversion rates by addressing user needs comprehensively
