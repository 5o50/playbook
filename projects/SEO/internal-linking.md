# Internal linking

> Here it the basic siloing, then you'll be able to cross links based on 
> you mindmap and buyers journey


Mother / Pilar page
is linking to two silios A and B
links going back and forth between sons and mother

Also brother are linked togethers


Grandsons links back and forth to the son
Grandsons link together but grandson do not link with grandson in other silos and not to the mother

Each links have different types of power

links between grandsons or brother are weak links
in the form of lists at the end of the content to notify it's just for google
to know who is in relation to what, not to push the page

Links that go down from mother to son
from sons to grandsons have medium power

Links that go back up the herarchy have the strongest power
they are position at the top of the content within the content
You gotta put that at the beginning of the content and within the text
not in sidebar, not in menu link, or anything like that
but inside the content and the first link matter
if you got multiple links pointing to the same page
only the first one in the source code count
so be careful


PLAY THE MYSTERY WORD GAME WITH INTERNAL LINKING ALSO
