more tickets more chances to win							some medium risk medium margin					CREATE		What is what you want to validate														
cut out on the one that fail, and maximise the profits on the wins							and a few high risk high margin					TEST & VALIDATE		UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE COMPARING

* hot new release tab: new product that sales well, go down the sub categories tree																												
* category tree method: start from something you love like "dogs" and go down each sub categories																												
* chatgpt: give me a list of dog products that are usually above $25 are small and lightweight, easy to manufacture, and we don’t want to sell anything that’s a food, clothing or electronic item and nothing that’s easily breakable																												
    what are some different types of dog beds																											
* data-driven approach: use a tool like junglescout																												
    selling 300/mo		max 250 reviews			launched in the last 12months			FBA/FBM																			
    between $25 and $75			max rating 4		Standard size

The key to finding high demand, low competition products is to really niche down (dig deeper) in your main category. The further you go into subcategories and the more specific you get, the better chance you have to find a market with limited competition.																												
Continue to dig deeper into every subcategory until you can find a low competition/high demand product with consistent sales history.																												
A great free way to find products is to check out the New Release section of any sub-category. 																												
The idea here is to find products that have just recently be launched and that are already selling well															generate product ideas

Fewer sellers could mean more opportunity																												
less popular categories can be more profitable than popular categories, fewer sellers list products in these categories, they can still be profitable																												
do what other people dont want to do																												
choose products with high search volume and few sellers for sale																												
Get creative! Be different ! don’t just sell in a popular category because that’s what everyone else is doing																												
avoid complicated products like electronics: lots of returns, lots of evolutions, lots of moving parts that can go wrong																												
avoid products that go on your body or in your body																												
avoid products with high customer loyolty to brands: shoes, clothings, bags, jewelry																												
avoid fads																												
avoid dangerous products																												
avoid patented products

DONT DO A PRODUCT UNLESS YOU HAVE A CLEAR PATH OF THE KEYWORDS YOU WILL RANK IT ON																												
Are customers brand agnostic? 																												
Don’t sell in a niche where customers are only looking for certain brand, but where they are open to price and innovation																												
branded keywords are very difficult to get clics & conversion on																												
brand loyalty matters: if they are searching for lego they are gonna buy lego --> not your cheap alternative

Red Flags																												
lot of chinese sellers / lots of similar listings																												
price has a tendency to go down																												
the new offer count is skyrocketing, too much supply, price wil go down																												
When the new offer count shoots up, this is a tell tale sign that prices will drop soon																												
I would be careful purchasing slower selling items where the new offer count is skyrocketing, because this could mean that a huge dump of this product was released into the market, which may mean that prices will absolutely tank on you.																												
If you ever see sharp declines in the new offer count for seemingly no reason, this could be a sign that the brand owner of the product is issuing IP complaints.																												
You want to avoid selling items that are known to give IP complaints and on listings where the only seller is the brand owner.																			listing building, brand building is the future of this business									
keep an eye out for sharp drops as that could mean you might be hit with an IP complaint																												
Green Flags																												
T10C have low rating but are still selling a lot -> customer are diying for us to improve																												
new offer count is holding still or declining, sellers are selling out and the supply is drying up, sales price can increase																												
When there is less competition and demand stays the same or increases, prices increase.																												
There are times where the new offer count may rise, but since the item is in such high demand, you could still sell it profitably even with the increased competition.																												
Delight your customers: Get customers loyal to you, not your prices

GOOD PROFITABILITY: la marge se fait à l'achat pas à la revente																												
Plenty of subcategories are not very profitable because of increased competition, price wars, direct competition from Amazon, and increased PPC costs.																												
Profitability does not depend on the main category’s popularity It depends on the niche chosen, the competitiveness of your product, price, cost of goods, and several other factors.																												
61% of all Amazon businesses price their products between $16 and $50																												
SHOULD BE AT LEAST ABOVE 35%
