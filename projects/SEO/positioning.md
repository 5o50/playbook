I don't think it's good that Apple's perceived as different. I think it's important that Apple's perceived as *much better*.

> Love your customers - say you make a code hosting service.\nit's hard to beat free (as is Google Code) and it's hard to beat the fact that, yeah, they have all the basic features a code host should have - but you compete where Google can't. \nYou beat them in the User Interface department\nyou beat them with warm, inviting documentation and a well designed, inviting website. \nYou beat them by hiring a support staff that actually answers emails and picks up the phone.

You can only do these things - building a brand - and building a "cult" by doing the things Google - given its robotic failings - cannot do. Love your users, infect them with your passion - not just your technical prowess or ability to scale or release new web codecs, or give them the right search results, or giving away source â€“ infect them with your passion for what you do. Support them, respond to them - even if you're giving it away for free - after all, nothing is free.

DIFFERENTIATE OUT OF YOUR AUTHENTICITY -- NO ONE CAN COMPETE BEING YOUSELF

SOMETHING THAT CANNOT BE EASILY BOUGHT OR COPIED

Provide relevant, compelling solutions that customers can only get from us.
