'A holding company is a business entity that has no operations and does not conduct any activities. It owns assets. These assets could be shares of other companies, hedge funds, real estate, trademarks, patents or units in partnerships. Grouping companies together under a holding company gives them advantages they would not have when operating as separate entities."
