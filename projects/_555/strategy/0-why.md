DETECT A MARKETPLACE THAT YOU CAN DOMINATE AND GROW

---
https://x.com/mulvaney_marc/status/1849094174513250700
starting a new e-commerce company and you think it could make millions? Unless you test it with paid ads first (meaning before you do all the work) Make an AI mockup website, install hotjar add products that you don't stock yet and immediately refund customers. 
Use that data to open a real branded e-com store and crush it! Pro tip: Unless you choose an evergreen niche, just PPC the hell out of it, because SEO takes time. Double Pro Tip: Calculate $20-$50 per cost of sale, so simply stay away from low margin items, it's literally not worth it. With any sale you can expect chargebacks, loss of goods, customer support, returns, broken items, returned used items, additional shipping costs, and negative reviews. Selling a $20 t-shirt won't cover any of those costs, I don't care what any of those Youtubers told you!

Market research: Whatever situation during start there is a demand and demand is growing
You have to go through every scenario and design a great path to buy in each scenario

WEIRD PROCUCTS !!!
FIND AN UNTAPPED MARKET: Start with a broad topic - it will be competitive, conduct deeper research - niche down the rabbit hole - until it's less competitive

you're intuition isn't enough! get deep insights, foster better stagetic decisions and customera alignment
* hot new release tab: new product that sales well, go down the sub categories tree
* category tree method: start from something you love like "dogs" and go down each sub categories
* chatgpt: give me a list of dog products that are usually above $25 are small and lightweight, easy to manufacture, and 
* data-driven approach: use a tool like junglescout
selling 300/momax 250 reviewslaunched in the last 12monthsFBA/FBM
between $25 and $75max rating 4Standard size
no legal or liability issues: patent/trademark/security
* trending products: use JS opportunity founder 
The key to finding high demand, low competition products is to really niche down (dig deeper) in your main category. The further you go into subcategories and the more specific you get, the better chance you have to find a market with limited competition.
Continue to dig deeper into every subcategory until you can find a low competition/high demand product with consistent sales history.
A great free way to find products is to check out the New Release section of any sub-category. 
The idea here is to find products that have just recently be launched and that are already selling wellgenerate product ideas
Edgy Niche market products are betterstart from a broad keyword and find all the trending sub keywords over the last 2 years using keyword searchanalyze the niches
Product Bundlesnarrow down
find viral products on tiktok
Fewer sellers could mean more opportunity
less popular categories can be more profitable than popular categories, fewer sellers list products in these categories, they can still be profitable
do what other people dont want to do
choose products with high search volume and few sellers for sale
Get creative! Be different ! don‚Äôt just sell in a popular category because that‚Äôs what everyone else is doing
avoid complicated products like electronics: lots of returns, lots of evolutions, lots of moving parts that can go wrong
avoid products that go on your body or in your body
avoid products with high customer loyolty to brands: shoes, clothings, bags, jewelry
avoid fads
avoid dangerous products
avoid patented products

find a good niche and launch 5 products
Put a lot of SKUs in your pipeline
constant loop
THERE IS ALWAYS A WHY BEHIND: if the why is big enough, the how is easy
you need cash and analyse it faster 
IDEATE
What is the hypothesis
it's based out of luck
we want many low risk low margin product
HYPOTHESISE
What is it that you're testing
more tickets more chances to win
some medium risk medium margin
CREATE
What is what you want to validate
cut out on the one that fail, and maximise the profits on the wins
and a few high risk high margin
TEST & VALIDATE
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE COMPARING
throw 100s of the sku on the wall, then rebalance on the results
we look at sales per day / profits per day
ALWAYS COMPARE APPLE TO APPLE. THE SLIGHTEST DIFFERENCE CAN SKEW THE RESULTS.
Keep stacking SKUs
If you're just throwing out something like spagetthis IDK WHY? ?
Treat it like a stock portfolio
launch the 10 best of the 30 in your pipeline only 8 of thes will work

1/ spot a niche problem (use reddit, discord)
ex: "golfers struggle with swing consistency"

2/ cruise throug github issues of popular repos unsolved problems = startup opportunities

3/ validate with data (google trends, glimpse) look for steady 5-year growth, not spikes

4/ focus on "forgotten" demographics 
ie: often overlooked/underserved in tech (eg: military spouses, immigrants grandparents etc)

5/ run $50 facebook ad tests cheap way to validate before building (i call this marketing r&d)

6/ build a dead simple microsaas one feature > bloated app (spend $5000 or less to build mvp, ok if its ugly to start)

7/ create a "velvet rope" launch fomo + exclusivity = organic growth (95% of mvps in 2024 could be a social account/group chat + waitlist)

8/ get 100 conversations (with minmax ai for cold email)
"what's your biggest pain around X?"

9/ bake virality into your product give users incentive to share (extra features, credits) make sharing as frictionless as possible

10/ iterate based on actual usage hotjar + fullstory = gold for user insights

11/ leverage "exit intent" popups for eal feedback "why are you leaving?" teels you what's missing

12/ word of mouth > ads make 10 users love you, they'll bring 100 more

13/ partner with 100 microcreations or be a full-on creator yourself (or both)

14/ show the behind the schenes, build in public but you dont need to share veerything

15/ dont raise vc unless you really need to or want to (can always raise later as youre scaling)
congrats, you've got a 2024/205 startup playbook

no down payment or mortgage needed

Two behaviours

52% of amazon users are using it for product exploration: learning about solution, what is possible for my specific problem. It may be replacmeent, something new, you havent heard of it, you have a problem you have no clue to solve it 
40%Information gatherers: shipped with Air in 9 to 11 days, consumers are less concerned with shipping speed if products are heavily discounted


18% Need based shoppers: I know I will buy but where, X X X, click, click, click -> BUY Directly shipped from China, No need for FBA // Fashion, Beauty, Home like Temu and Shein

L'Algorithme
sellersessions.com/best-a9-algorithm/
https://sellersessions.com/a9-bot/
The A9 algorithm prioritizes relevance and user experience.
Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that your product listings are highly relevant to the search queries of your target audience.
This includes using relevant keywords and ensuring your product is in the correct category.
The algorithm also considers factors such as popularity, brand, and customer ratings when determining the In-Category Relevance Score.
Therefore, focusing on improving these aspects can also help you compete more effectively.

## google ads
Main objective for Google is to 
SHOW THE MOST RELEVANT ADS
that advertise THE MOST RELEVANT LANDING PAGES
to the USERS INITIAL SEARCH
The Factors that Determine Your Ad Rank:
- **your bid**: max amount you are willing to pay per clic
- **quality of you ads & landing page**: "quality score": google goal is to match the most relevant ads & relevant landing pages to the users search intent
- **ad rank**: your ad rank is the product of your bid and your quality score
- **current Ad Rank Thresholds**: min. standard an ad must achieve to be shown in the auction
this are different per auction so the goal here is to focus on creating targeted ads & landing pages
for the relevant keywords
- **Competitivness of the auction**: more competition = higher cpc
- **The Context of the user's search**: recent search terms by the user, their location, demographics, recent ads they have interacted with and "other user signals and attributes"
- **Expected Impact of your ad asset and other ad formats**: You have the option to include ad assets suchs as phone numbers or links to other parts of your website. If Google believes these assets will increase the chance for a click you are likely to get a higher ad rank.

SEGMENT YOUR MARKET
CREATE ADS FOR EACH SEGMENT
MAKE TIGHLY HROUPED KEYWORD AROUND SPEFICI TOPICS (5 keywords per adgroups)
When people dont have enough info they use Specificity as a proxy for value
if someone is more specific around something, we naturally think they are more likely to be better at it
we naturally think they are more likely to help us with the issue we have around it
CREATE SEPARATE LANDING PAGES FOR EACH ONE OF THOSE AD GROUPS

start with search only and expand with performance max campaigns

for bidding strategy go with conversation value or conversions not clicks

Dropshipping Tip: 

Use pipiads for product research 

Find a product scaling well on TikTok 

Check that store isn‚Äôt running on meta, if they aren‚Äôt then that = opportunity 

Take product & creatives to meta 

Test & validate 

Custom creatives & scale.

Dropshipping tip:

You NEED to upsell in cart and post purchase. It can be the difference between a profitable or unprofitable day, especially at a lower ad spend.

1 product = $
1 product + cart upsell = $$
1 product + cart upsell + post purchase upsells = $$$

Use UpCart for cart upsells and AfterSell for post purchase upsells.

$300,000+ in sales in the last 90 days on this store.

Just 1 product, 1 in cart upsell, 1 post purchase upsell and some email/text automations like abandoned checkout and win back flows.

Advertising on Facebook, TikTok and Google.

Using these apps: UpCart, AfterSell, Loox, SMSBump, Omnisend, ParcelPanel.

Dropshipping has never been easier as long as you put in some effort. Build a branded store, make custom images, get your own UGC and you‚Äôll do numbers.

Pets
Beauty Tools
New Parents
Health/Wellness (Pain Relief)

Find products with PiPiAds and estimate sales using ShopHunter.

Can also make $ selling products for Halloween, Xmas, Valentines, etc but they‚Äôre seasonal.

Find a problem solving product
Build a website on Shopify
Use Zendrop as your supplier
Order the product & film ads
Launch ads on Facebook & TikTok
Review ads after a few days
If any are profitable, increase budgets
If any are unprofitable, turn off

Use PiPiAds to find trending products
Build your store on Shopify
Use Zendrop as your supplier
Run ads on Facebook & TikTok

Run ads on Facebook Instagram TikTok

Supplier - Zendrop to start then 3P
Cart Upsells - UpCart
Post Purchase Upsells - ReConvert
SMS Marketing - SMSBump
Advertising - TT, FB & Google Ads
Reviews - Loox
Payments - Shopify Payments + PayPal

Again, study your competitors, identify their best-performing ads and make yours even better. You can chop up your own videos in CapCut, use AI, or hire UGC creators to remake those video ads for you. I hire creators through Billo.

Test the product with paid ads:

You can set up your fb testing campaign with this structure:

1 ABO Campaign
4 Adsets at $10/day each (3 interests, 1 broad)
3 different creatives in each adset

Run your ads for 3-5 days, scale up what worked, turn off what didn‚Äôt work.

If you‚Äôre getting profitable sales at this low budget slowly start to increase budgets every 3-4 days of everything that is working.

*The smaller the market, the easier it will be to become a leader.*

Products that aimed for too mainstream a market and only had lukewarm users include WebTV, grocery delivery, and smartwatches.
Products that had lots of passionate early adopters but failed to cross the chasm include Lisp, LiveJournal, RSS, VR (both times), and cryptocurrency.

CHARACTERISTICS: NEWNESS, PERFORMANCE, CUSTOMIZATION, GTD, DESIGN, BRAND/STATUS, PRICE, COST REDUCTION, RISK REDUCTION, ACCESSIBILITY, CONVENIENCE/USABILITY

WHAT INCREDIBLE BENEFIT CAN WE GIVE TO THE CUSTOMER

Niche Market Strategy
> hyper-targeted marketing, just-in-time manufacturing, and social media
> find and engage their audience wherever they may be
> micro-brands: low overhead costs, elegant design, and hyper-efficient customer acquisition strategies
*Becoming a leader in a market with well-established players is unlikely.*
*Instead of trying to battle over saturated, broad markets, find a narrow market and a specialized product or service.*
*Smaller is bigger in business, and smaller is not all over the map; it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s highly focused.*
*These days, the trend is toward smaller niches.*

You want an idea to have a few passionate users rather than lots of lukewarm users, because there's an activation energy to building a habit and if you're only lukewarm you're not going to get over it.

(Deep, Intelligent, Complete, Elegant, Emotive) products that make segments of people very happy. And fear not if these products make other segments unhappy. The worst case is to incite no passionate reactions at all, and that happens when companies try to make everyone happy.

This query appears to be describing a blueprint or strategy for rapidly scaling an e-commerce business to $100,000 per month in revenue. Let's break down the steps:

## Blueprint Overview

1. **Find a viral TikTok shop product**: Identify a product that's trending or has viral potential on TikTok.

2. **Steal 8 viral videos**: Gather 8 popular videos related to your product, likely for inspiration or repurposing.

3. **Create a BOGO offer**: Develop a "Buy One, Get One" promotion to attract customers.

4. **Launch Facebook ads using the EWITZ method**:

   **CBO (Campaign Budget Optimization)**: 
   - Set a daily budget of $100
   
   **Adset structure**:
   - Use 1 adset with broad targeting
   - Enable Dynamic Creative
   
   **Ad creation**:
   - Upload the 8 viral videos
   - Create 3 compelling primary text variations
   - Include 3 different headlines

This strategy combines product research on TikTok with an aggressive Facebook advertising approach. The goal is to quickly test and scale a product using broad targeting and multiple creative variations to find what resonates with the audience[2][4].

It's important to note that while this blueprint presents a potentially rapid path to scaling, success is not guaranteed. E-commerce businesses often require careful planning, testing, and optimization to achieve sustainable growth[1][3].

While I understand you're looking to improve this strategy, it's important to approach marketing and business growth ethically and sustainably. Let's consider some ways to refine this approach that align with best practices and legal considerations:

Product Selection:
Instead of just finding a "viral" product, focus on identifying products that solve real problems or fulfill genuine needs for your target audience. Conduct market research to understand demand and competition.
Content Creation:
Rather than "stealing" viral videos, create original content. This could involve:

Partnering with influencers to create authentic product demonstrations
Developing your own unique video concepts that showcase your product's benefits
User-generated content campaigns where customers share their experiences


Offer Strategy:
While BOGO can be effective, consider other promotional strategies that provide value:

Limited-time discounts
Bundled products
Loyalty programs
Free shipping thresholds


Ad Campaign Structure:
The basic structure (1 CBO, 1 broad adset, dynamic creative) is a good start. To improve:

Test multiple ad sets with different targeting to find the most responsive audiences
Gradually increase budget as you find winning combinations
Use A/B testing to optimize ad elements (copy, creatives, etc.)


Content Variety:
Diversify your ad content beyond just product videos:

Customer testimonials
Behind-the-scenes content
Educational content related to your product niche


Landing Page Optimization:
Ensure your website is optimized for conversions:

Fast loading times
Clear, compelling product descriptions
Easy navigation and checkout process
Mobile responsiveness


Customer Service:
Implement excellent customer service to encourage repeat business and positive word-of-mouth.
Data Analysis:
Regularly analyze your campaign data to understand what's working and what isn't. Use these insights to continually refine your strategy.
Compliance:
Ensure all your marketing practices comply with platform policies (e.g., Facebook's ad policies) and relevant laws (e.g., truth in advertising, data privacy).
Realistic Expectations:
Instead of aiming for an unrealistic "$0-100k month," set gradual, achievable growth targets based on your market research and initial results.

Remember, sustainable business growth typically takes time and consistent effort. Focus on building a brand that provides real value to customers, and your marketing efforts will be more likely to succeed in the long term.

This guy pulled off one of the most exponential (but controversial) app launches of all time.

In just 10 days, he was adding 30,000 new users PER HOUR.

That‚Äôs more than 8 per second.

ùóõùó≤ùóøùó≤‚ÄôùòÄ ùòÅùóµùó≤ ùó≤ùòÖùóÆùó∞ùòÅ ùü≤-ùòÄùòÅùó≤ùóΩ ùó¥ùòÇùó≤ùóøùóøùó∂ùóπùóπùóÆ ùó∫ùóÆùóøùó∏ùó≤ùòÅùó∂ùóªùó¥ ùóΩùóπùóÆùòÜùóØùóºùóºùó∏ ùóµùó≤ ùòÇùòÄùó≤ùó±:

But first - who is he and what exactly was the app?

Nikita Bier famously sold his first company ‚Äòtbh‚Äô to Facebook for $100m.

After his non-compete clause expired, he quit and started his next venture, ‚ÄòGas‚Äô.

‚ÄòGas‚Äô is a polling app that lets high-schoolers anonymously compliment their friends.

After launching in August 2022, Nikita and his team:

- Made $3m in 3 months
- Sold to Discord for $7m in 4 months

So how did he grow it so fast?

ùü≠. ùóõùóÆùó∞ùó∏ ùòÄùóºùó∞ùó∂ùóÆùóπ ùóΩùóπùóÆùòÅùó≥ùóºùóøùó∫ ùó±ùó∂ùòÄùòÅùóøùó∂ùóØùòÇùòÅùó∂ùóºùóª

To create hype and exclusivity, he would target specific high schools 1-by-1.

For each high school, he created a private Instagram account with the school‚Äôs name.

For example, '@gas.georgiahigh'.

ùüÆ. ùóßùóÆùóøùó¥ùó≤ùòÅùó≤ùó± ùóºùòÇùòÅùóØùóºùòÇùóªùó± ùóÆùó∞ùóæùòÇùó∂ùòÄùó∂ùòÅùó∂ùóºùóª

Nikita discovered that teenage Instagram users would often list their school in their bio.

He crawled each school‚Äôs page and followed all accounts that referenced the school‚Äôs name.

ùüØ. ùóïùòÇùó∂ùóπùó± ùóÆ ùóØùóºùóºùòÅùóπùó≤ùó¥ ‚ÄòùòÑùóÆùó∂ùòÅùó∂ùóªùó¥ ùóπùó∂ùòÄùòÅ‚Äô

Most students, curious about the mystery profile, would request to follow back.

But Nikita wouldn‚Äôt accept any requests‚Ä¶

yet.

ùü∞. ùóüùóÆùòÇùóªùó∞ùóµ ùó±ùóÆùòÜ ùòÄùóΩùó∂ùó∏ùó≤

At 3:00pm on launch day, when everyone got out of school at the same time, he accepted all the follow requests simultaneously.

Every student got the ‚Äòfollow accepted‚Äô notification at once.

The result?

ùü±. ùó©ùó∂ùóøùóÆùóπ ùòÄùóºùó∞ùó∂ùóÆùóπ ùó≥ùòÇùóªùóªùó≤ùóπ

Large numbers of students in a concentrated area started showing each other and talking about Gas‚Ä¶

at the same time.

When they opened the Instagram profile, they saw a simple bio:

‚ÄúSee who likes you‚Äù with a link to download Gas.

ùü≤. ùó•ùó≤ùóΩùó≤ùóÆùòÅ ùóÆùóªùó± ùó∂ùòÅùó≤ùóøùóÆùòÅùó≤

Nikita conducted these launches every few weeks, targeting one high school at a time.

Each launch he spotted inefficiencies and further automated the process.

The best part?

He spent $0 on paid marketing.

So - what do you think about his launch strategy?

Ethical or questionable?

#### Fundamentals
SEO is the process of growing a website's organic traffic
you do things that help you show up and rank higher in a search engine organic results
People are likely searching for what you do and you can attract customers by ranking for those terms.
Unlike other channels, search traffic tends to be consistent and passive. That‚Äôs because the number of searches is usually quite consistent month to month.
Search traffic is also ‚Äúfree.‚Äù That‚Äôs a big deal because ads can be expensive

#### How ?

SEO involves five main steps:
1. Keyword Research: Find what people search for
2. Technical SEO: Help search engines find, crawl, and index you content efficently
3. On-page SEO: Make your content as clear as possible
4. Content creation: Craft content for searchers
5. Link building: Build trust and authority from other websites


#### Create a logical site structure
It should be easy for visitors and search engines to find content on your site
Its important to create a logical hierarchy for your content
You can do with a mindmap

Internal links are crucial for UX and SEO for a few reasons:
- They help search engines find new pages. Google can‚Äôt index pages it can‚Äôt find. 
- They help pass PageRank around your site. PageRank is the foundation of Google search. It judges the quality of a page by analyzing the quantity and quality of links that point to it. It‚Äôs still used by Google today.[
- They help search engines understand what your page is about. Google looks at the clickable words in the link for this, otherwise known as anchor text.

You need to pass through the four great fitlers of marketing:
- to be noticed
- to be remembered
- to be remembered in buying situtations
- to be talked about

HOW TO REACH OUR CUSTOMERS
through which channels do our customers segments wnat to be reached ?

What type of relationship does each of our customer sgement expect us to establish and maintain with them ?

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou must recognize that you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do business with everybody,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù

√∞≈∏≈í¬è THINK GLOBAL, ACT LOCAL (LOCAL + GLOBAL = GLOCAL)

**1 - Identify the target** √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù With whom do you want to do business? Be as specific as you can. 
*If you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know whom you want to do business with, you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make contact. Otherwise, you risk exhausting yourself and confusing your customers.*
- geographic range
 - types of customers:
- Targeting teenagers isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t specific enough; targeting male, African American teenagers with family incomes of $40,000 and up is.
- Aiming at companies that sell software is too broad; aiming at Northern California-based companies that provide internet software sales and training and have sales of $15 million or more is a better goal.
2 - **Focus Process** √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù Clarify what you want to sell √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù √¢‚Ç¨≈ìmaternity clothes for executive women.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
Your niche isn't the same as the field in which you work √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù a retail clothing business is not a niche but a field
- you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be all things to all people
- smaller is bigger
- Make a list of things you do best and the skills implicit in each of them.
- List your achievements.
- Identify the most important lessons you've learned in life.
- Look for patterns that reveal your style or approach to resolving problems.
- Your niche should arise naturally from your interests and experience. For example, if you spent 10 years working in a consulting firm but also spent 10 years working for a small, family-owned business, you may decide to start a consulting business that specializes in small, family-owned companies.
**3. Describe the customer√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s worldview.**
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìDo unto others as they would do unto themselves.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
When you look at the world from your prospective customers√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ perspective, you can identify their needs or wants. The best way to do this is to talk to prospective customers and identify their main concerns.
**4. Synthesize & Evaluate**
At this stage, your niche should begin to take shape as your ideas and the client√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s needs and wants coalesce to create something new. A good niche has five qualities:
- It takes you where you want to go√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùin other words, it conforms to your long-term vision.
- Somebody else wants it√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùnamely, customers.
- It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s carefully planned.
- It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s one-of-a-kind, the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìonly game in town.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
- It evolves, allowing you to develop different profit centers and still retain the core business, thus ensuring long-term success.
 - Now it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s time to evaluate your proposed product or service against the five criteria in Step 4. Perhaps you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll find that the niche you had in mind requires more business travel than you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re ready for. That means it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fulfill one of the above criteria√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùit won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take you where you want to go. So scrap it, and move on to the next idea.


 Pay heed to conceptual fidelity. Are you shooting at the right target? Do people have the values you think they do? Do they really want the features/benefits you claim they want? As one example, there have been a multiple of projects that attempt encrypted communication over Facebook and other social networks (NOYB [22], FlyByNight [32], Lockr [53], FaceCloak [33], Scramble! [7], etc.), but the lack of adoption suggests that the usability costs do not outweigh the benefits to users.

 THERE IS NO AVERAGE USERS. PERSONAS DOESNT EXIST. HAVE GENUINE COMPASSION FOR THE USER. EVERY USER IS DIFFERENT
 
 - **External Image Matters more than function**
     - PEOPLE ARE GOING TO USE THE PRODUCT IN PUBLIC. Packaging matters.
     - People don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t buy the product for it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s functionality but for its self-expressive benefits, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s brand image.
 - In human sexual selection strategy a product that will increase your reproductive success will always win over one that mainly represent functionality (survival).
