Market research: Whatever situation during start there is a demand and demand is growing
You have to go through every scenario and design a great path to buy in each scenario

WEIRD PROCUCTS !!!
FIND AN UNTAPPED MARKET: Start with a broad topic - it will be competitive, conduct deeper research - niche down the rabbit hole - until it's less competitive

you're intuition isn't enough! get deep insights, foster better stagetic decisions and customera alignment
* hot new release tab: new product that sales well, go down the sub categories tree
* category tree method: start from something you love like "dogs" and go down each sub categories
* chatgpt: give me a list of dog products that are usually above $25 are small and lightweight, easy to manufacture, and 
* data-driven approach: use a tool like junglescout

* trending products: use JS opportunity founder 
The key to finding high demand, low competition products is to really niche down (dig deeper) in your main category. The further you go into subcategories and the more specific you get, the better chance you have to find a market with limited competition.
Continue to dig deeper into every subcategory until you can find a low competition/high demand product with consistent sales history.
A great free way to find products is to check out the New Release section of any sub-category. 
The idea here is to find products that have just recently be launched and that are already selling wellgenerate product ideas
Edgy Niche market products are betterstart from a broad keyword and find all the trending sub keywords over the last 2 years using keyword searchanalyze the niches
Product Bundlesnarrow down
find viral products on tiktok
Fewer sellers could mean more opportunity
less popular categories can be more profitable than popular categories, fewer sellers list products in these categories, they can still be profitable
do what other people dont want to do
choose products with high search volume and few sellers for sale
Get creative! Be different ! don’t just sell in a popular category because that’s what everyone else is doing
avoid complicated products like electronics: lots of returns, lots of evolutions, lots of moving parts that can go wrong
avoid products that go on your body or in your body
avoid products with high customer loyolty to brands: shoes, clothings, bags, jewelry
avoid fads
avoid dangerous products
avoid patented products

1/ spot a niche problem (use reddit, discord)
ex: "golfers struggle with swing consistency"

2/ cruise throug github issues of popular repos unsolved problems = startup opportunities

3/ validate with data (google trends, glimpse) look for steady 5-year growth, not spikes

4/ focus on "forgotten" demographics 
ie: often overlooked/underserved in tech (eg: military spouses, immigrants grandparents etc)

5/ run $50 facebook ad tests cheap way to validate before building (i call this marketing r&d)

6/ build a dead simple microsaas one feature > bloated app (spend $5000 or less to build mvp, ok if its ugly to start)

7/ create a "velvet rope" launch fomo + exclusivity = organic growth (95% of mvps in 2024 could be a social account/group chat + waitlist)

8/ get 100 conversations (with minmax ai for cold email)
"what's your biggest pain around X?"

9/ bake virality into your product give users incentive to share (extra features, credits) make sharing as frictionless as possible

10/ iterate based on actual usage hotjar + fullstory = gold for user insights

11/ leverage "exit intent" popups for eal feedback "why are you leaving?" teels you what's missing

12/ word of mouth > ads make 10 users love you, they'll bring 100 more

13/ partner with 100 microcreations or be a full-on creator yourself (or both)

14/ show the behind the schenes, build in public but you dont need to share veerything

15/ dont raise vc unless you really need to or want to (can always raise later as youre scaling)
congrats, you've got a 2024/205 startup playbook

no down payment or mortgage needed

Two behaviours

52% of amazon users are using it for product exploration: learning about solution, what is possible for my specific problem. It may be replacmeent, something new, you havent heard of it, you have a problem you have no clue to solve it 
40%Information gatherers: shipped with Air in 9 to 11 days, consumers are less concerned with shipping speed if products are heavily discounted


18% Need based shoppers: I know I will buy but where, X X X, click, click, click -> BUY Directly shipped from China, No need for FBA // Fashion, Beauty, Home like Temu and Shein
