- who are you ? (explain whats your story, put down your heart and your guts, what your value, why you here for, why how what) if its just for money say it
does tha sounds too good to be true ? describe your brand in a very unfamiliar way, let loose
- What are we doing now ? (I'm on your page, what's next ?)
- Why you ? (why should we keep on continuing the journey ?) what would happen if you didnt exist
try to pick a real or fictional character that we can easily imagine what you brand abbout because of relations
