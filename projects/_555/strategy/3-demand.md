**DataDiveNormalizer**
The Normalizer is a text processing tool that removes the plurals and conjunctions from keywords. This is mainly used for PPC campaigns as it prevents overlapping keywords from competing with each other for the same search terms. 

two types of clustering

**Morphological clustering**
This method focuses on the linguistic structure of keywords, identifying similarities based on their morphology. It groups keywords by analyzing elements like root words, stems, or suffixes to find common meanings or linguistic connections. For example, words like run, runner, and running might be clustered together due to their shared root. This approach is ideal for understanding semantic relationships between keywords.

**SERP-based clustering**
This method evaluates keyword relevance by comparing SERPs. It identifies clusters by checking if multiple keywords return similar URLs in their search results. For instance, if two different queries frequently display the same pages in the top results, they are grouped together. SERP-based clustering reflects how search engines interpret keyword intent, making it particularly useful for understanding competitive landscapes and user intent alignment.

## Résumé complet sur l'interprétation de la taille des marchés

La taille d'un marché est un indicateur crucial pour évaluer son potentiel économique et sa maturité. Voici un résumé complet des points essentiels à comprendre :

### Échelle de grandeur des marchés

1. Marché de niche (< 100 millions €) : Très spécialisé, peu d'acteurs, potentiel limité mais stable.
2. Petit marché (100 millions - 1 milliard €) : Local/régional, opportunités pour PME et start-ups.
3. Marché moyen (1 - 10 milliards €) : National/international émergent, potentiel de croissance significatif.
4. Grand marché (10 - 100 milliards €) : International mature, dominé par de grandes entreprises.
5. Marché géant (> 100 milliards €) : Mondial, oligopoles fréquents, innovations rares mais impactantes.

### Facteurs clés à considérer

- Dynamique de croissance : TCAC et cycle de vie du marché.
- Segmentation : Identification de niches au sein de grands marchés.
- Concentration : Mesurée par l'indice Herfindahl-Hirschman (IHH).
- Barrières à l'entrée : Réglementations, brevets, économies d'échelle.
- Marge bénéficiaire : Souvent plus élevée dans les marchés de niche.
- Internationalisation : Impact sur la taille et le potentiel du marché.
- Innovation et disruption : Influence différente selon la taille du marché.
- Écosystème et effets de réseau : Plus développés dans les grands marchés.

### Implications selon la taille du marché

- Petits marchés (ex: 500 millions €) :
  - Souvent locaux ou régionaux
  - Opportunités pour les PME et start-ups
  - Potentiel de niche avec marges élevées
  - Plus vulnérables aux innovations disruptives

- Grands marchés (ex: 10 milliards €) :
  - Généralement internationaux
  - Dominés par de grandes entreprises
  - Forte concurrence et barrières à l'entrée élevées
  - Écosystèmes développés et effets de réseau importants

La compréhension approfondie de ces aspects permet une meilleure évaluation de l'attractivité et du potentiel d'un marché, au-delà de sa simple taille. Chaque taille de marché présente ses propres défis et opportunités, influençant les stratégies d'entrée, de croissance et de concurrence des entreprises.

Pour mieux comprendre le Taux de Croissance Annuel Composé (TCAC), voici une échelle de grandeur qui peut vous aider à interpréter les différentes catégories de TCAC et leur signification :

## Échelle de grandeur pour le TCAC

1. **TCAC très faible (0% - 2%)**
   - **Description** : Marchés stagnants ou en déclin léger.
   - **Exemples** : Industries matures où la demande est stable mais peu dynamique, comme certaines catégories de produits alimentaires.

2. **TCAC faible (2% - 5%)**
   - **Description** : Croissance modeste, souvent liée à des marchés établis avec une concurrence accrue.
   - **Exemples** : Marchés tels que les montres de luxe, qui peuvent croître lentement en raison de la saturation et des préférences des consommateurs.

3. **TCAC moyen (5% - 10%)**
   - **Description** : Croissance significative, souvent dans des secteurs en développement ou avec des innovations récentes.
   - **Exemples** : Marchés comme les accessoires pour téléphones portables, où la demande est soutenue par l'innovation technologique.

4. **TCAC élevé (10% - 15%)**
   - **Description** : Croissance rapide, souvent dans des niches émergentes ou des secteurs en forte expansion.
   - **Exemples** : Marché des parfums de niche de luxe, avec un TCAC prévu de 14,52% entre 2023 et 2032[1].

5. **TCAC très élevé (> 15%)**
   - **Description** : Croissance explosive, généralement dans des marchés innovants ou disruptifs.
   - **Exemples** : Marché de l'impression à la demande, avec un TCAC projeté de 25,8% entre 2023 et 2030[3].

### Importance du TCAC

- **Évaluation du potentiel** : Le TCAC permet d'évaluer le potentiel de croissance d'un marché sur plusieurs années.
- **Planification stratégique** : Les entreprises utilisent le TCAC pour planifier leurs investissements et leurs stratégies d'entrée sur un marché.
- **Comparaison entre marchés** : Le TCAC facilite la comparaison entre différents marchés ou segments, aidant ainsi à identifier les meilleures opportunités.

En résumé, le TCAC est un outil essentiel pour comprendre la dynamique des marchés et orienter les décisions stratégiques basées sur les perspectives de croissance.


# World Wide Web

Le web c'est à plus de 80% de basse qualité
20% spam
60% basse qualité
20% haute qualité

1 milliard de sites web actifs (100,000 sites utiles et 10,000 keywords plus utilisés)
le pareto devrais plutot etre 200,000,000 de site mais en réalité il ya un regroupement tres fort de certains sites qui sont les plus utiles. les pages vraiment important sont tres peu nombreuses
le besoin principal des gens est toujours le même ce qui facilite les prédictions
25 milliards de pages web en 2024 et 90 milliard de liens qui vont a la poubelle tous les jours 
=> bcp de spam
croissance du web est exponentielle
Chaque minute, environ 175 nouveaux sites web sont créés2. Les chercheurs estiment également que la taille du web double tous les 5,32 ans
 Cette expansion est alimentée par l'augmentation des contenus multimédias tels que les images et les vidéos, qui augmentent considérablement la taille des pages web. Par exemple, la taille moyenne d'une page web est passée de 702 Ko en 2010 à 3422 Ko en 2017

Facture d'energie monstrueuse pour crawler tout le web par Google
vue sa taille et sa croissance c'est plus une bonne idée dutout
30 premier resultats de recherche c'est suffisant pour la plupart des requêtes
au dela de la troisieme page, pas d'interet
aujourdhui ou t'es top 100 out t'es top 10, il n'ya pas d'info intermediaire de toute facon
tu prendras de meilleure decisions avec moins d'infos

## Global Market Share

## Search Volume Range
Search volume can vary significantly by industry, location, and seasonality

### Search Engine

3 biggest content-search engines:

1. Google
2. YouTube
3. TikTok

> THEY WANT TO FIND THE RIGHT INFORMATION THAT FITS YOU

Searchable database of web content

Made of two parts:
- Search Index: library of metadata about web pages
- Search Algorithm: programs that match results from the search index

Goal: Provide the best, most relevant results for users.

## A -Building seach index
#### URL
Begins with a known list of URLs.
From backlinks: google already index hndreds of billions of pages, when someone links to a new page from a known page google can find it from here
From sitemaps: tells google which pages and files you think are important on your site
URL submissions: site owner can request crawling of individual URLs

#### Crawling
where a computer bot called a spider visits and downloads known URLs. Googlebot.

#### Processing & Rendering
Understand and extract key information from crawled pages
It has to render the page, which is where it runs the page's code to understand how it looks for users

Nobody outside of Google knows every detail about this process.
It does not matter. All we really need to know:
=> extracting links
=> storing content for indexing

#### Indexing
Processed information from crawled pages gets added to the search index
Search index is what you search when you use a search engine
Users cannot find you unless you're in the indexed


## B - Search Algorithms
formulas that match and rank relevant results from the index. Google uses many factors in its algorithms

Discovering, crawling, and indexing content only make up the first part of the puzzle. Search engines also need a way to rank matching results when a user performs a search. This is the job of search algorithms.

Nobody knows every Google ranking factor because Google hasn’t disclosed them. But we do know some key ones. Let’s look at a few of them.

#### Backlinks
links from a page on one website to another
one of Google’s strongest ranking factors
strong correlation between linking domains and organic traffic
Quality > Quantity: few high-quality backlinks often outrank many low-quality backlinks

#### Relevance
usefulness of a given result for the searcher
many ways of determining this:
- pages containing the same keywords as the search query
- interaction data to see if others found the result useful

#### Freshness
query-dependent ranking factor: stronger for searches that call for fresh results
That’s why you see a recently published top result for 
“new netflix series” but not “how to solve a rubik’s cube.”

#### Page speed
ranking factor on desktop and mobile
more of a negative ranking factor than a positive one
negatively affects the slowest pages rather than positively affect lightning-fast pages

#### Mobile-friendliness
ranking factor on mobile and desktop since Google’s switch to mobile-first indexing in 2019


## C - Personalization
Google tailors search results for each user. 
Google saves the things you do and places you go to give you a more personalized search experience.[13] You can opt out of this, but most people probably don’t. 
uses information from user browser or ip: 
- location: personalize the results for searches with local intent
  all results for “italian restaurant” are from or about local restaurants
- language
  there’s no point in showing English results to Spanish users
  ranks localized versions of content (if available) to users who speak different languages.
- search history

THE MYSTERY WORD GAME
the first 500 words, the beginning of the content is most important
it needs to answer the mystery word game exactly like WIKIPEDIA does it
NEWS ARTICLES are not doing a very good job

you have a good page, if you describe the topic without saying the topic
2, 3 times have the keyword and thats it, no more



TRY TO READ YOUR CONTENT WITHOUT THE KEYWORD
CAN WE STILL GUESS THE KEYWORD? 

If you speak of IronMan Hulk SpiderMan
Google is capable of guessing you're talking about Marvel

If you speak about british luxury car where the symbol is an animal
It can guess it's Jaguar, but be careful with "animal" entity here
it can be confused with "animal" entity when you speak of "car"
