What we want: **LOW COMPETITION**

Measure competition - can you reach page one, can you stand out ?

Reviews: 
> less than 100 for 10 best selling listings


*Customers are brand agnostic?* 
Donâ€™t sell in a niche where customers are only looking for certain brand, but where they are open to price and innovation
branded keywords are very difficult to get clics & conversion on
brand loyalty matters: if they are searching for lego they are gonna buy lego --> not your cheap alternative

*Fast moving market ?*
Bluetooth earphone, smartwatch, wifi router
It's hard to be a premium product in a fast moving market: Cheap one are selling so fast you' re not gonna stick high

**Red Flags**
- lot of chinese sellers / lots of similar listings
- price has a tendency to go down
- the new offer count is skyrocketing, too much supply, price wil go down
When the new offer count shoots up, this is a tell tale sign that prices will drop soon
I would be careful purchasing slower selling items where the new offer count is skyrocketing, because this could mean that a huge dump of this product was released into the market, which may mean that prices will absolutely tank on you.
If you ever see sharp declines in the new offer count for seemingly no reason, this could be a sign that the brand owner of the product is issuing IP complaints.
You want to avoid selling items that are known to give IP complaints and on listings where the only seller is the brand owner.listing building, brand building is the future of this business
keep an eye out for sharp drops as that could mean you might be hit with an IP complaint

**Green Flags**
- T10C have low rating but are still selling a lot -> customer are diying for us to improve
- new offer count is holding still or declining, sellers are selling out and the supply is drying up, sales price can increase
When there is less competition and demand stays the same or increases, prices increase.
There are times where the new offer count may rise, but since the item is in such high demand, you could still sell it profitably even with the increased competition.
