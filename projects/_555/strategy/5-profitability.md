GOOD PROFITABILITY: la marge se fait à l'achat pas à la revente
Plenty of subcategories are not very profitable because of increased competition, price wars, direct competition from Amazon, and increased PPC costs.
Profitability does not depend on the main category’s popularity It depends on the niche chosen, the competitiveness of your product, price, cost of goods, and several other factors.
61% of all Amazon businesses price their products between $16 and $50
SHOULD BE AT LEAST ABOVE 35%
Product Lifecycle: Product will be relevant for: 12m-, 24mo-, 24mo+, 5y+(-200,-50,+50,+100)
ROI (Profit / Net Landed Cost): 40%-, 100%-, 100%+, 150%+, 200%+(-150,-100,+50,+100, +150)
rule of thirds: 1/3 Net Landed Cost, 1/3 Amazon fees, 1/3 profits
