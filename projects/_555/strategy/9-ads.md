 ## Bidding Strategies



## Title

1. STRONG AD SEARCH -> AD COPY
   mirror what the propect is looking in your ad copy
   exact words show up !
   pin the keywords in position 1
   this also helps with you quality score
   "Google Ads Agency"

2. Include ONE CLEAR CALL-TO-ACTION within the copy of your google ad
   DIRECT, clear, concise and easy to understand
   "Schedule a call"
   "Take a look at our fantastic track record - case studies"
   "Book Your Free Roof Survey Now"
   DONT INCLUDE MORE THAN ONE CALL-TO-ACTION
   if too large in the title put it in the description

3. Include your brand name or product brand name
   if there is positive brand recognition within your space
   yur want it clear, front and center in the headline
   if you're selling something people are likely to recognize based on brand name
   ONLY IF IT DOES APPLY TO YOU

4. Go straight to HIGH LEVEL EMOTIONS, not just benefits, not just features
   Ladder it up to the benefits, MAKE IT BENEFIT RICH
   Ladder up those benefits to HIGH LEVEL EMOTIONS
   Feature => Benefit => Emotion
            WHY      WHY

   not just loose weight
   "Get beach body ready with 50% off gym membership today"
   thats why someone wants to loose weight
   KEEP ASKING WHY, to LADDER UP
   youll endup to core human desires
   - desire for improved status
   - desire to be healthier
   - to improve relationships

   why do they want to join the gym ?
   to loose weight

   why do they want to loose weight ?
   to look good on the beach

   why do they want to look good on the beach ?
   they were embarassed last time, and felt that negatively affected their relationships with they friends or maybe their partner was looking at them and they wanted to be more attractive...

   so think about whats the end end goal of all of this ?

6. COULD YOU OFFER A GUARANTEE ???? 
   WE NEED TO GET THIS IN THE ADS THE CLICK WILL GET TO THE ROOF !!
   INCLUDE GUARANTEES IN AD COPY, YOU COULD MAKE IT CONDITIONAL (you need to come to all the sessions otherwise that guarantee is invalid) thats reasonable ! you cannot guarantee anything if they actually dont do the work
   GURANTEES ARE VERY VERY POWERFUL BECAUSE IT REVERSES THE RISK
   IN ANY BUY THERE IS ALWAYS RISK INVOLVED, THATS WHY BRAND IS SO IMPORTANT
   WHEN YOU SAY NIKE YOU THINK THATS LIKELY TO DO THE JOB
   WHEN UNBRAND YOURE LIKE MAYBE THIS IS FAKE PRODUCT
   GUARANTEE ARE SO POWERFUL PARTICULARLY FOR SMALL BUSINESS OR LOCAL
   ESPCIALLY WHEN COMPETITORS ARE NOT OFFERING THEM
   LIKE PERSONAL TRAINERS, ACCOUNTANTS, LAWYERS, ETC
   IF YOU CAN INCLUDE A GUARANTEE IN YOUR AD COPY, PUT IT PROMINETNLY IN THE COPY
   - GUARANTEED wieght loss with PT / Lose 10lb within 3 months, or I will work with you for FREE until we hit the objective!
   - Money Back, If You'Re Not Happy
   - 100% Money Back Guarantee
   - GUARANTEE YOU LOSE 10lb within 3 moths or you get your money back!
   - LOSE 10lb WITHIN 3 MONTHS or I will keep working with you for free until we hit that objective!

7. MAKE YOU ADS TO STAND OUT FROM THE COMPETITION
   best results comes from doing something better than the competition
   do 5 versions of headline and test
   - HUMOUR: can you try and be funny about your ad ?
   - CURIOSITY: can you intice more clicks by introduction elements of curiosity ?
   - A BIT CHEEKY+GURANTEE: "we'll beat your current agency or take your whole team on vacation"

---

1. Think about your prospect desired outcome// "le result qu'ils veulent"- relevant to what you're selling
what do they really want ?
"Get In The Best Shape Ever"
"Save 60% On ..."

1. Make it very clear and very specific about your offer
   Free Consultation
   Free Audit
   Limited Time 40% Off

2. Get the keywords your targeting in the headline
   Add dynamically with {} -> Keyword insertion and add a default case if no keyword is found
   Title Case

3. Address objections
   Clinically Proven
   Deadlines Met Or Money Back
   No Side Effects
   No Prescription Needed
   No Insurance Required

4. Avoid "Dead" words: words that everyone uses, this is wasted space
   "Award Winning"
   "High Quality"
   "Guarantee"

5. Include Numbers or statistics
   "#1 Accountant in Bristol"
   "75% Average Improvement"

6. Research competitors headlines
   which ads stick around
   which they keep using ?
   those are those with best performance

   TEST AND TEST AGAIN

or best selling thing

and tailor message to that specific target

with low budget, trust Meta,
avantages+ audiences, follow their recommendations

no Brand Awareness, no Brand Lift on low budget

The **Omnipresent Campaign Strategy** for Meta (Facebook and Instagram) Ads is a marketing approach designed to make your brand appear "everywhere" your target audience interacts online. This strategy leverages the extensive reach of Meta platforms, along with advanced targeting features, to create a comprehensive and consistent presence across multiple touchpoints. Here’s how it typically works:

### 1. **Broad Targeting with Layered Messaging**
   - **Initial Awareness**: Use broad campaigns to introduce your brand to a wide audience with engaging, attention-grabbing content like videos or carousel ads.
   - **Layered Retargeting**: Segment users based on their interaction with your content (e.g., views, clicks, or visits) and retarget them with ads that match their engagement level.

### 2. **Multi-Content Format**
   - Employ various content formats (videos, static images, carousels, stories, and reels) to maintain interest and engagement.
   - Showcase different aspects of your brand, such as testimonials, product demonstrations, behind-the-scenes content, or value-driven messaging.

### 3. **Sequential Advertising**
   - Guide your audience through a customer journey with ads that evolve over time. For example:
     1. Awareness: Highlight the problem your product solves.
     2. Consideration: Share testimonials, reviews, or product demonstrations.
     3. Conversion: Offer promotions, discounts, or limited-time deals.

### 4. **Custom Audiences and Lookalikes**
   - Use data-driven targeting by creating custom audiences (e.g., website visitors, email subscribers) and expanding reach with lookalike audiences based on these groups.

### 5. **High Ad Frequency Across Placements**
   - Ensure your ads appear across all available Meta placements, including:
     - Facebook and Instagram Feeds
     - Stories and Reels
     - In-stream videos
     - Audience Network
   - This creates the "omnipresent" effect, making your brand consistently visible.

### 6. **Dynamic Creative Testing**
   - Test multiple creatives and copy variations within the same campaign to identify which resonates best with different audience segments.

### 7. **Focus on Lifetime Value (LTV)**
   - Instead of prioritizing immediate sales, the strategy often emphasizes long-term customer relationships by building trust and familiarity.

### Key Benefits:
   - **Increased Brand Recall**: By consistently showing up across various placements and formats, your brand stays top of mind.
   - **Enhanced Trust and Authority**: Seeing your brand repeatedly can establish credibility.
   - **Higher Conversion Rates**: Strategic retargeting ensures you reach users at different stages of their journey with relevant content.
