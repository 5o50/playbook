**CONTENT MARKETING**
1. CREATE BLOGS POSTS, VIDEOS, PODCASTS OR WHATEVER with the goal of attracting or retaining customers
2. PROMOTING IT pick 2-3 and get really good at them (below the order of most popular channels)
    (search (organic or paid) / social medias / forums & communities / Email newsletters)

1. Find topics people are actually searching for and relevant to your business (keyword research)
2. Create the right type of content 
   One that meets the searchers needs -> Search intent
   (Google tries to surface the most relevant content for any given query)
3. Promote your content: inside-out approach: 
    start from channels closest to you and move outward to reach new audience
    1. start posting it on your social media account
    2. send new content to your email newsletter
    3. branch out to communities you're involved in: reddit, quora, social groups with link sharing
    4. finally Bloggers outreach to get backlinks
    5. few hundreds $ on ads to amplify the content

# People have a problem
# They search for solution
# CONTENT from blogs, videos, reviews leads them through their entire purchasing journey

MAP THE CUSTOMER JOURNEY !!! (create a content ecosystem for your business)
imagine what they do when 
1. they have a problem
2. they search for solution
3. they look for content to guide their purchase
   

Content creation: Craft content for searchers
- create content and distribute it
- content should be valuable, relevant, and consistent
- know how you're targeting (clearly defined audience) to attract and retain them
- MOST IMPORTANTLY: content should drive profitable customer action

# Topical Mesh: Stop thinking about keywords, start thinking about topics
0. Choose a topic
1. Analyse the Semantic Corpus
2. Define the related topics
3. Create the pairs Related Topics X Intents
4. Configure the Internal Linking through Semantic Proximity
5. Pubish the Topical Mesh & Analyse the results

## CART framework: for more critera it fits the better you're campaign will do
C for Content: think of a topic and format you'll use
A for Audience: clearly defined audience
R for Relevance: keep it relevant to your product will ensure its serving your business
T for Timing: being in the right place at the right time


Content types:
- Blog posts
- Videos
- Product pages
- Category pages
- Landing pages

Content format: (mostly to blog posts and landing pages but not for ecommerce)
- How-to guides
- Step-by-step tutorials
- List posts
- Opinion editorials
- Tool (landing page)
- Calculator (landing page)

Content angle: your "hook" as to why someone should click and visit your page (USP)
- Freshness
- Deals


Two goals when writing content:
- The content should drive traffic to the site
- The content should engage those people

MATH THE CONTENT AND FORMAT OF THE SERP angle can vary 

## Build a data-driven outline
Outline is the skeleton of your content
It forms the base and all you need to do is fill the missing pieces
This ensure you include all critical points worth communicating on the topic
helps you statisfy the algorithm and the audience

To build your outline
Check most ranked paged topics or Content Gap with competitors

## Create a clic-worthy headline 
keep in mind if you content does deliver the headline, it will do more harm than good

How to [Achieve a Desired Outcome]
[Number] Proven [Actions/Ways] to [Achieve a Desired Result]
[Number or How to] Simple/Easy Ways to [Achieve Desired Outcome] [Challenge]
[Number] Reasons You're [Not Achieving Desired Outcome]

## Write a killer intro using the AIDA formula

Quel type de contenu publier sur votre blog ?
Vous devez penser à la manière dont vous allez attirer votre audience (via les moteurs de recherche, les réseaux sociaux, des liens externes, etc.). On peut distinguer deux grandes familles de contenu :

Les sujets « chauds » qui couvrent l’actualité et les sujets tendance de votre secteur. 
Les contenus « froids », guide, tutoriel, dossiers thématiques, etc. 
Sur votre blog, variez les contenus froids et chauds, dans la mesure où votre secteur est bien sûr concerné. 


### Shorter Content (300-500 words): 
Suitable for product pages or specific queries where concise answers suffice.
product descriptions, homepages, or thin content. For example, in one study, the majority of websites (521 out of 751) had relatively low word counts

### Medium-Length Content (1,000-2,500 words):
Ideal for in-depth blog posts or articles targeting competitive keywords.
average word count for top-ranking pages on Google. For instance, the mean word count of a Google first-page result is 1,447 words. Many websites optimize for this range to balance depth and readability.

### Long-Form Content (3,000+ words):
Useful for comprehensive guides or topics requiring detailed explanations.
A smaller percentage of websites produce long-form content, but these pages tend to perform better in terms of backlinks, traffic, and engagement. Articles with 3,000+ words can generate up to 6.4x more traffic and 5x more backlinks compared to shorter content





----
Average Blog Post Worf Count By Industry

Marketing / Advertising: 2,500 - 3,000 words
Sales: 2,500 - 2700 words
Retail: 1,500 - 1,700 words
Tech: 800 - 1,000 words
Finance: 2,000 - 2,500 words
Fashion: 800 - 950 words
Real estate: 1,800 - 1,900 words
----


While short content is abundant due to its ease of production, long-form content outperforms it in critical metrics like traffic, engagement, and authority, making it more effective for SEO and user satisfaction.

Exact percentages depend on the dataset analyzed, but studies consistently show that short content dominates in volume while long-form content excels in performance metrics.

Many websites prioritize creating a high number of pages with minimal content to target numerous keywords or topics, which contributes to its dominance in volume

Performance metrics are measurable indicators used to evaluate how well content performs in terms of user engagement, SEO rankings, and traffic generation.

Organic Traffic: Long-form content tends to attract more visitors over time due to its depth and relevance
Engagement Metrics: Users spend more time on pages with comprehensive content, leading to higher "time on site" and lower bounce rates
Backlinks: Long-form articles often earn more backlinks because they are seen as authoritative and valuable resources
Conversions: Detailed guides or articles can drive higher conversion rates by addressing user needs comprehensively

## Authenticity

https://x.com/dentesleo/status/1872013151836733893?s=46

It has to be imperfect to be real. 

Authenticity is to understand: An human is imperfect and perfectly human.

Authenticity is imperfect by definition. The more you try to polish, the more you try to make what you publish perfect, the less people are drawn to you because it doesn’t sound real. 

It sounds like something that’s been worked on, reworked, and reworked again… so it loses all its charm.

This is also a concept you can find in the art of dressing well. 

There’s this Italian concept that, in my opinion, is so beautiful to explore and study, called sprezzatura. Essentially, sprezzatura is about looking effortless, without really being effortless. 

It’s about looking beautiful while seeming unkempt.

And this is exactly what your content should look like. It should be imperfect while still being striking, sharp, visceral—something that touches people in their soul, not just their eyes. 

Many people try to optimize for readability and skimmability. But the truth is, if you really want to break through, if you want to become people’s hero—and that’s what you should aim for if you’re writing content—you need to incorporate elements of imperfection. 

It has to be imperfect to be beautiful. 
It has to be imperfect to be real.

# Blog Mogul

Static.com
- Looper, an entertainement blog (41M monthly visitors)
- Mashed, a food blog (25M monthly visitors)
- The List, a lifestyle blog (21M monthly visitors)
- Tasting Table, a food blog (18M monthly visitors)
- Nicki Swift, a celebrity blog (18M monthly visitors)


Tip: If a network own multiple sites in the same niche - like Static and their three food blogs - try to find commonlities betwen the type of content they're publishing. If something bings in a lot of clicks and / ior ranks easily on one site, they'll write the same kind of content for another one of their sites to take up more search result real estate.

You can find similar content each site is publishing by taking your time and clicking around manually or if you have access to a paid too like Ahrefs you cna use their content gap feature to see similar keywords they're targeting.

Just two of Static's food blogs share over 80,000 keywords in common in the US alone. A lot of these multiple rankings will not be accidental.

Make content that's shareable.

why people share things ? 

there is only 3 core reasons.

1. is them saying: "you need to see this!"
    lifehacks, learning something new, tips, hot take someone you know agree with. 
    Most of TikTok content is like this.

2. they're saying: "you won't believe this!"
    mostly shock value or entertainment based content
    the OG of it all in the internet, the "charlie bite me" level youtube videos.
    just the extreme of you wont believe this is real.
    Most of TikTok content is like this.

3. "let's do this!"
    the obvious, these are experiences, these are products you might want to try.
    I think about driving foot traffic to local establishments.
    how restaurants say "this is the best restaurant in austin for 2024"
    "POV you're looking for a date night thats non-alcoholic"
    "let's do this, let's try!"
    Most of Instagram content is like this.

Ignite that light in the mind which lights the way for action.

Start from the end.

Don't critizise, condem, complain.
It's futile, it puts a person on the defensive.
It's dangerous, it wounds a person pride, hurts his sense of importance, arouse resentment.

Give honest appreciation
we all desire to be important 
talk about what they want
show them how to get it

The right thing at the right moment
Be human, be real, be authentic
Add value to their lives, dont ask for value

Inspire with action every day, christlikeness.

Humans are not creatures of logic, they are creatures of emotion.
Bristling with prejudice, motivated by pride & vanity.


We are all flawed and imperfect.
Particularly the less fortunate, the mistaken, the afraid.
Be civilized and respectful.

Talk about what it feels like
No facts - no attacks on anyone

Don't tell what to think.

If you cannot relate to other people pain, you are not in the right team.

If you cannot be kind, if you won't emphathize, team humanity, we are all in this together.

RELATABLE
Does that look familiar to the viewer ?

RELEVANT
Is it a topic everyone talks about RIGHT NOW ?
use trends and momentum (timely) (actionable tips) ()

SHAREABLE
Is it something people want to talk about with their friends ?
=> shock factor in content & form (taboo)

---
Don't explain, argue.

Divide & Conquer

Writing is not about communicating your ideas, it's about changing readers ideas.

Education is the best marketing.

What is valuable is not in the content or in the world. What is valuable is in the readers minds.
Start from what is in the readers minds.

Persuation depends on what they doubt, why they are wrong.

Know your community.

No desperate moves.
Demonstrate impressively.
Bruce Lee.

Concentre toi sur la lumière, pas l'obscurité.
Be your own light.

Time is now !

Do not penetrate the essence of things.
The meaning of which we do not know anyway.
Develop concepts which allow us to talk in a productive way about phenomena in nature.
Niels Bohr

Step #1

HOOK ATTENTION
what could I do to get people hooked ?


Step #2

RETAIN ATTENTION
Video length does not matter as long as you can keep someone attention
keep it conscise


---

Great content is KING
Easy distribution is QUEEN
Ecosystem is KINGDOM
Consistency is GOD

9AM once a week

Hashtags, thumnails, post timings, post frequencies.

---

Focus on the relationship between things

--- 
Give hope continuously, it only needs one man to change the world.

---

A vision can only be as inspiring as the amount of people tha tit positevely impacts.
--
produire des idÃ©es, c'est bien mais pas suffisant : il faut Ãªtre crÃ©atif tout au long du processus crÃ©atif, y compris en phase d'Ã©valuation au cours de laquelle il faut faire preuve d'imagination dans la transformation et l'interprÃ©tation des idÃ©es proposÃ©es.
---

The closer you are to the pain, the more you can empathise with others.

---

The scene is a conversation.
The content is a conversation, the characters keep the reader focused.
