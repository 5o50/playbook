1 CALL TO ACTION BUTTONS !!! MAKE THEM EASY TO REACH ALWAYS VISIBLE
- got a number of CTAs
- above the fold !
- put more that you think you need to
- make them visible enough, CONTRAST !!!
- text needs to be descriptive of the action you want people to take
    "ORDER NOW", "BUY NOW" "ENQUIRE HERE" "SIGN UP"

2 CONGRUITY between ads and landing pages
  if they see an ad and click and get the slightest hint of a different offer on the landing page, they will click the back button and you paid for the click for nothing
  - different language
  - different tone
  - different images
  - different offers
  - different benefits
  - different specificity
  match it all !!!


  3 CREATE SEPARATE LANDING PAGES
  segment it out, be more specific => higher conv rate
  because they will feel they landed on a location that has a product or service that is just for them
  - instead of roofing services landing page
    - split it in separate spefici service landing pages
      - roof replacement
      - leak detection
      - gutter work
  so you create ads for each and match the landing page

4. MAKE INFORMATION AS EASY TO CONSUME AS POSSIBLE
   NO PARAGRAPHS OF TEXT EVER !!!! REDUCE ALL EFFORTS
   BREAK PARAGRAPHS INTO BULLET POINTS
   USE IMAGES
   USE VIDEO
   USE BULLET POINTS
   USE NUMBERS
   USE BOLD TEXT
   USE HIGHLIGHTED TEXT
   USE QUOTES
   USE SUBHEADINGS

   MATCH THE LEVEL OF DETAILS AND INFORMATION ON THE LANDING PAGE
   WITH THE SIZE OF THE ASK

   small ticket = less info
   high ticket = more info

   generally try removing info instead of adding more
   because you dont want it to feel like effort to your customer

   5. INCLUDE VISUAL ASSETS AND MAKE IT MATCH THE MOOD OF WHAT THE CUSTOMER EXPECTS FOR (EXCITING OR TRUSTWORTHY OR INNOVATIVE) AND PROFESSIONAL
   - use high quality images
   - use video
   - use testimonials
   - use social proof
   - use quotes
   - use numbers
   - use bullet points

  6. reduce NAVIGATION LINKS AND OPTIONS
   BUT DONT PUT IT TO ZERO ELSE GOOGLE WILL PUNISH YOU
   - reduce site navigation
   - reduce other links
   - reduce other options
   - reduce other products
   - reduce other services
   - reduce other offers
   - reduce other benefits
  in the nav only put options that will increase chance of conversion
  not unrelated stuff but stuff that increase likelihood of conversion
  like:
  - case studies
  - testimonials
  - portfolio
  not random home, about, contact, etc
  where do I want them to go, where I want to make it harder for them to go ?

  7. **TRUST SIGNALS**: IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU CAN DO
    - REVIEWS particularly INDEPENDENT REVIEWS
    you can put reviews youve collected yourself
    but its not going to be as powerful as a TRUSTPILOT page
    or GOOGLE REVIEWS, somewhere people know you dont have control over
    - TESTIMONIALS, video testimonials for all sorts of product/services including on landing pages or text testimonials
    BUT VIDEO TESTIMONIALS ARE THE BEST it moves people through the sales funnel in real time, they want that final little bit,
     that really helps them get em off the edge
    - ACCREDITATIONS, badges, awards, certifications, etc for certain industries
    - PROOF OF YOUR WORK, portfolios, results, screenshots, image or video form

The page is personalized to match the buyer’s intent and encourages customers with a straightforward call to action (CTA). Page content includes engaging headlines, high quality images, concise copy and social proof elements like customer testimonials and customer reviews.

Landing Pages are what grabs the visitor’s attention, keeps them on your site and starts their shopping experience.

feature content that is clear and concise so the value proposition is easy to understand

centered around a clear objective of getting customers to complete a set goal


A shopper might have an upcoming trip and would like to purchase new luggage, so they search on Google for “Best Luggage for Travel”. In the search results, they click on a link with the title “The Perfect Luggage for the Modern Traveler”. 

When they land on the page, they see a headline that matches this ad and images of modern suitcases. There’s also a CTA button offering a promo code for a 30% discount. The page also includes subheadings that emphasize the suitcase’s durability, a money back guarantee, and testimonials from existing customers. 

The page offers exactly what the shopper was looking for, and the added social proof builds trust and convinces visitors that these suitcases are top quality. They also can’t pass up the 30% discount offer, so they click the CTA button to shop directly from the page. 

In this scenario, the shopper was able to find exactly what they were looking for in a matter of seconds. The page’s content fit the buyer persona, included important product features, added trust, and made it easy for the shopper to purchase. As a result, the site converted a visitor into a potential buyer. 

And this is what landing pages are for: to convert visitors into customers.

### Differences between ecommerce landing pages and product pages

Most times when visitors come to your site they will land on the homepage or a product page. This might be great for introducing visitors to your brand or providing product information. However, these pages don’t necessarily elicit action. 

In fact, visitors who land on a product page are 72% more likely to bounce than those who land on a landing page. 

Why?

Because landing pages are designed and optimized for conversion goals. 

Product pages are more for informing, while landing pages are for converting. As a result, each page uses different elements to help support achieve their intent. 

Here’s an overview of the differences between product pages and landing pages:

Landing Pages

Contains only 1 clear CTA

Removes additional pathways such as site navigation

Content is written around one goal, for targeted audiences

Includes product descriptions (again, written for specific audiences)

Optimized for marketing campaigns, not necessarily SEO

Product Pages

Contains a clear CTA, but can include multiple CTAs

Features additional pathways, such as site navigation and product categories

General content that is written for the masses

Includes product descriptions and product recommendations

Optimized for SEO to attract organic traffic 

Let’s use the example from above to illustrate the difference between product pages and landing pages. 

If the shopper’s search for “Best Luggage for Travel” takes them to a product page, they will see general product information for one suitcase and a button to buy. There’s also site navigation with links to categories like “Laptop Cases” and “Handbags”, and links to other recommended products. 

In comparison, if the search takes them to a landing page, they will see a message about modern, durable suitcases and a single CTA button for a 30% discount off their purchase. There is no site navigation, and does not feature other products that the site offers. 

Using this example, both have a CTA that encourages customers to make a purchase. 

However, the product page is more general. It acts as an introduction to the site and offers paths for visitors to explore. There are multiple CTAs, in the case that some customers might not be ready to buy on the spot but want to see more and compare their options. 

Meanwhile, the landing page has only one message and one CTA. The message is directly tied to the search terms, so the customer’s intent is met when they land on the page. The offer is also directly related to this message, and there is a clear path to achieve the conversion goal without distraction.  Despite the differences, both product pages and landing pages are necessary for your site. They simply serve different purposes when it comes to your overall marketing efforts. 

#### Why you need landing pages for your ecommerce site

Ecommerce landing pages are a key part of the sales funnel. It is the link between when a customer first sees your ad campaigns, to when they go to your online store and close the deal with a purchase. 

Beyond that, effective landing pages can be beneficial to other aspects of your overall marketing efforts.

> Drive higher ROI for paid traffic.
Your ecommerce site could have the best online advertising. You could master PPC campaigns with sky high click-through rates, and dominate email marketing with strong open rates. 

But if your leads never convert, what’s the point? 

Those visitors who come from paid traffic have a certain set of expectations when they land on your ecommerce site. There’s already a set intention, and they want to click on something related to their search. 

By having landing pages built to marketing campaigns, you can meet these expectations and as a result drive higher ROI for paid traffic. 

If someone searches and clicks on an ad for “Winter Jacket” then is taken to a homepage featuring other clothing products, they will likely bounce. This paid ad didn’t direct them to what they were looking for, and they didn’t want to take the time searching a site. If the ad takes them to a page featuring this season’s winter jackets and a CTA to buy, there’s a better chance they will stay on your site and possibly make a purchase. 

In other words, you won’t be wasting ad spend. 

> Great for testing
 Since landing pages are designed for specific marketing initiatives, this is a great opportunity to try new things and see what’s the best way to reach audiences.

A/B test your landing pages to see what works and what doesn’t work. Compare what CTA buttons get the most clicks, what special offers get visitors to buy on the spot, and even what color text appeals more. 

Not only does this help determine what landing pages are converting best, the insights from a/b testing can be applied in your other marketing efforts. 

For example, if a landing page for a specific campaign has a high bounce rate, it may not be a PPC campaign worth pursuing. Or if a landing page with Image A tested better than a landing page with Image B, then Image A is likely a better asset to use in social media promotions. 

> Can target specific customer segments
By having several personalized landing pages, you can better target specific customers.

Design your landing pages to fit specific customer segments. What aesthetic appeals most? What value propositions do they need? What CTA triggers a response?

Everything from the headline, images, even the CTA button text should fit the buyer persona. For example, a landing page for an email campaign targeting Gen Z should be optimized for mobile since that is the preferred device for that segment. 

The better you can connect with customers, the more likely they are to stay on your site and click your CTA.

> Quick and easy to put together.  
The thought of setting up several landing pages, each personalized to marketing campaigns and specific customers, might sound like an overwhelming amount of work. 

But it doesn’t have to be. Using a landing page builder, you can easily customize different elements of your page. You can also use premade themed templates that take the hassle out of designing pages from scratch. 

And the payoff is worth it.  That’s because the more landing pages you have the better. In fact, Hubspot found that having 10-15 landing pages can increase your leads by 55%.


#### 4 types of ecommerce landing pages + strategy

Not only should landing pages be personalized to fit the visitor’s interests, it should also fit where they are in the sales funnel. Landing pages for first-time visitors who are simply exploring will be dramatically different from those who have already been on your site and began shopping. 

This means using different landing pages for different marketing campaigns including awareness, remarketing, upsell and re-engagement campaigns. 

Each of these types of ecommerce landing pages will be centered around a unique objective, ranging from boosting brand awareness to encouraging customers to make another purchase. As a result, the content will vary — especially the CTA. 

Here’s a breakdown of the 4 types of ecommerce landing pages:

> Top of funnel landing page (Notoriété)
Top of the funnel landing pages will be for introducing your ecommerce site to new visitors. 

This page will be used for lookalike campaigns, with audiences similar to your existing customers. These are visitors who may not know about your brand yet, but it’s likely that they will be interested in your products. 

As this is your first impression, this page could include content like:

Your brand story and why you exist 

Solutions your products offer

Social proof to establish credibility

At this stage, visitors are likely not ready to buy so the CTA should focus on making a connection and lead generation. For example, offering a 10% discount on their first purchase when they sign up for your newsletter. Now they have an incentive to come back and you’ll have their email address to reach them again without having to use ad spend. 

> Mid-funnel landing page (Considération)
Mid-funnel landing pages are for those customers who have shown interest in your site but have not yet converted. 

This page will be for retargeting campaigns. These visitors will be familiar with your brand, maybe even have a few items picked out, but still need extra convincing.

Content on this page should be focused on giving that little nudge that converts those on the fence. This can include:

Content around specific products (i.e. a headline like “If you can’t stop thinking about it, buy it”)

Social proof to show who else has bought the product and positive reviews

Sense of urgency or limited time offers (i.e. “Almost Gone”)

This type of landing page will have a CTA that drives a purchase. For example, having a button with the text “Buy Now”. This makes the path to purchase convenient and quick, encouraging them to checkout right away. 

> Bottom-funnel landing page. (Conversion)
Bottom-funnel landing pages are designed for the customers who have been on your site, added everything they want to a shopping cart but stopped short of hitting buy. 

This page is for upselling campaigns, as customers are already in a buying mindset and there is an opportunity to offer them additional products. 

Upselling content should tell customers not only to buy, but to buy more. This includes:

Bundle offers (i.e. “Complete your order with….”)

Content around related products (i.e. “Frequently Bought Together” items)

A discount related to cart abandonment, such as free shipping

This page’s CTA focuses on closing the deal first. Then, if possible, see if you can push additional products with a higher average order value. For example, a CTA saying “Make Your Order Complete” with content specifically promoting bundles related to the customer’s abandoned cart. 

Note: It’s best to test the upsell first, then move into offering discounts. 

> Already purchased landing page. 
Already purchased landing pages aim to keep your existing customers happy and coming back to your site.

This page is used for re-engagement and retention campaigns for increasing customer lifetime loyalty (LTV) and repeat purchases (retention).

Since the content for this page is targeting existing customers, you don’t need to go into detail about who you are and what you offer. Instead, focus on content that ensures your customers stay customers. This can include:

Customer loyalty incentives (i.e. Earn points on every purchase)

Sneak previews to new products

Early access to sales or exclusive deals

Category pages related to previous purchases

Opportunities for customer referrals (i.e. Invite your friends and get rewarded)

Unlike other stages of the sales funnel, the CTA focuses on the customer experience. It’s less about getting customers to make a purchase right away, and more about building a strong, lasting relationship. Make customers feel valued and special. For example, giving existing customers access to a sale before it is available to the general public with the CTA saying “Start Shopping Early”.


#### Best practices for your landing pages

Every page you create will be unique to specific ad campaigns, customer segments and sales funnels. But there are some best practices that have been proven effective for ecommerce landing pages across the board. 

Here are the must-try best practices:

> Limit the clutter.
A great landing page is straightforward and easy to follow. This means limiting the clutter on your page. 

You don’t want to lose a conversion because the visitor was overwhelmed by too much text, or getting lost trying to find the “Buy Now” button. 

Some tips for limiting the clutter include:

Concise, to-the-point headlines

Visible and clear CTA (more below)

Removing site navigation links

Relevant, high-quality images

Bullet points for product details

Keep in mind that it takes just seconds for a visitor to decide to stay on your site or bounce. This means it’s unlikely that they’ll sit and read everything on the page, especially if there’s a lot of text. 

It’s more likely that they will skim the page and see if it fits what they were looking for. That means every page element matters, and should have a clear purpose for why it is being included. 

Avoid the fluff, don’t add content just because — keep to the value proposition.

> Include a visible, clear CTA.
Visitors should know as soon as they land on your page what your offer is and how they can take advantage of it. 

To accomplish this include a visible, clear CTA.

Unlike other pages on your site, landing pages should only have one CTA. Giving visitors only one choice makes their decision much easier, opposed to having to analyze and choose among several options. This advances visitors into the sales funnel more quickly and without distractions — making it ideal for conversions.  

The CTA should be displayed prominently, be easily accessible, and targeted to specific customers. This can be done by:

Placing your CTA at the top of the page, above the digital fold

Including multiple buttons for a single CTA throughout the page

Using active voice for button text (i.e. Sign up for Free)

Create a sense of urgency or exclusivity (i.e. Claim Your Offer Now)

Like we mentioned before, landing pages are great for testing. This is especially true for your CTA. Even the slightest changes can make a difference.  Regularly test different CTA elements such as button text, button placement, button color, etc. 

> Use high-quality images. 
With the limited time and space you have on landing pages to convince visitors, images matter. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words right?

Use high-quality images that fit with the landing page objective. For instance, if the page is focused around mid-funnel campaigns for specific items, it would be useful to use product images. 

Be sure that images are optimized for all devices. Especially mobile, which is becoming increasingly popular for ecommerce transactions. Images should fit nicely on the phone without needing to zoom out or scroll down. 

Not only do images add a visual appeal, it also plays a vital role in building trust in credibility. Some ways you can leverage social proof through images includes:

Testimonials that include the customer’s photo

User-generated content of customers using products

Media recognition and trust seals (i.e. As featured in….)

Endorsements with pictures of the celebrity or influencer

Only use images that will enhance your landing page. Low quality images that are pixelated, have poor lighting, or don’t fit with the content are better left off.
