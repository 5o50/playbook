Landing Pages


Pages/videos that:
- present the product
- explain how to use the product
- review the product

those pages sell very well


If you're just too lazy, just build backlinks and fight with others

if you want to be smart and give google and people what they want
google is throwing up product pages, it cant take it anymore
be smarter smell the serp
understand what does google want, stop feeding what google has present or past

People need to fully understand your product and “get it”

5 seconds to answer:
- How are you going to help me out ?
- who are you ? (explain whats your story, put down your heart and your guts, what your value, why you here for, why how what) if its just for money say it
does tha sounds too good to be true ? describe your brand in a very unfamiliar way, let loose
- What are we doing now ? (I'm on your page, what's next ?)
- Why you ? (why should we keep on continuing the journey ?) what would happen if you didnt exist
try to pick a real or fictional character that we can easily imagine what you brand abbout because of relations
MINDMAP THE BUYER PERSONA
- START AT THE CENTER WITH THE BENEFIT not with what you sell GO BEYOND THE PRODUCT OR THE SERVICE
  what are you really selling behind the product and the services to your personas ?
  explore and draw the whole buyer journey of options and alternatives
  think from the mind of the persona, not your keywords
