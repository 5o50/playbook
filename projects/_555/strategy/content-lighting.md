# Light Direction

Creating shadow reveals form which help us to better understand the object.

Golden hour: 30 minutes after sunrise or before sunset.
Blue hour: an hour after sunset or before sunrise.

A small light source can amplify smaller details.
A large light source can amplify larger details.

Light fall off is the decrease of light intensity as the distance from the light source increases.
Everytime you double the distance from the light source, the light intensity is divided by 4.

When the light source is close to the object, the shadows are sharp and the highlights are bright.
When the light source is far from the object, the shadows are soft and the highlights are dim.
