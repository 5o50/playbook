You act like you have no rights

I was placing and prioritising everyone else’s potential judgements, feelings and rights way above my own.

Why did I feel such a need to be accepted at the same time as wanting to express myself? It’s a struggle that many people go through.

**Relief**

When you know where some of these feelings come from, it is easier to break away from them. If you can get into the habit of expressing yourself and being more assertive, then the fear starts to drop away every time you realise that it hasn’t killed you after all. You can change every habit bit by bit, until it feels normal and natural to be yourself.

Everyone has the right to be who they really are. And, fundamentally, no-one has more rights than anyone else. We are all human beings, no more, no less. You don’t know what’s going on in someone else’s head, so stop worrying about what they might think (you don’t actually know) and remember they are a human being just like you.

A nice strategy I tried whenever I encountered anyone and felt anxious was to say to myself in my head “human”. In this way, the person was no more or less than I was – they were equally human.

This is a good way of stopping yourself from comparing yourself with others too – another trap that leads to insecurity, anxiety and low self-esteem. **If they are human, they will have a mix of weaknesses and strengths, just like you.** Don’t siphon people off into “better “richer” “nicer” “more attractive”. It’s all relative. Just think of them as “human” and leave it at that. Then you are equal.

The people you really want in your life will not care what you like or don’t.

if you just go ahead and change to who you want to be, who you truly are, you’re only facing fear once.

It’s an enormous relief to not stifle yourself and it’s much more fun being you than worrying what people will think about you. And the more you let your true self shine through, the more you will realise that. There is no-one more content than someone who is good-hearted and genuine. The ultimate question is: Do you want to have a happier life or not?
