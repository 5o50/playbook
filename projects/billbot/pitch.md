Introducing effortless invoice chasing

You didn’t get into business to hassle your customers for money. It’s the most time consuming and frustrating part of doing business.

Missed calls, ignored emails and wasted time.

We provide a smart, professional and patient AI Agent that works tirelessly, to collect what you are owed.
This saves time, energy and unlocks cash flow.

Allowing you to focus on what matters most—growing your business.

Why Agents?

We spoke to business owners and found something fascinating: many created a ‘persona’ to handle the burden of chasing down payments.

These personas were named ‘Dave’, ‘Trish’ or ‘Laura’; sometimes with their own phone number and email, this made-up persona allowed business owners to avoid bringing up the awkward issue of payment directly, "Trish will send the invoice..".

Business owners want to focus on maintaining good customer relations and cash flow, not hassling people for payment.

This is where our Invoice Agents come in, they are your digital accounts receivable assistants. And our agents run as a co-pilot so you have complete visibility and control over every action.
You can set up our agents with any name you like, with your company email and branding.

Your personal AI Agent, will do the rest – improving cash flow and reducing headaches.

What is an AI Agent?

Imagine an employee who knows only one thing: how to get your invoices paid. We developed the AI Agent to do just this. An AI Agent is a software program designed to assist with or complete tasks for humans.

Agents do not tire of  the dull, tedious tasks like chasing bills, spotting invoice errors and they work to streamline your accounts receivable process.
Our AI scores each invoice and rates the likelihood it gets paid on time. This dramatically reduces invoice errors.
Onboarding customers is faster and error-free. Eliminating invoice mistakes that slow payment time. With tireless, accurate focus, the agent makes sure your debtors’ pay on time and get your cash into your bank account faster.

AI agents love data. The more data you give, the more insights you get; from areas where you can improve onboarding customers, to identifying customers who need a nudge from the agent to send on that payment.

Why do you need an invoice agent?

Managing accounts receivable is one of those “must-do, don’t-want-to-do” tasks that every business faces.
It needs to be done, but it’s easy to let it slip.

Your agent is your accounts receivable co-pilot – with smarts to identify issues and offer actionable advice, patient and persistent to get your invoices paid and seamlessly move your accounts through the payment cycle.

Your pile of unpaid invoices is a stack of cash waiting to be unlocked, and an agent is the key.
