Speech Mastery

Best speech tempo
3 words per bars

Spoken Words Per Minute (wpm)

500wpm -- max human capability (feels like 2x)
250wpm -- average
200wpm -- Tony Robbins (simple words)
170wpm -- Simon Sinek
150wpm -- Conversational
120wpm -- Slow Conversational (complex subjects)

Video Formats
60 sec -- 120 to 200words / 40 to 66bars
15 sec -- 30 to 50 words / 10 to 16 bars
8 sec -- 15 to 25 words / 5 to 8 bars avg attention span for social media
7 sec -- gets boring like powerpoint
6 sec -- complex or contemplative mood
5 sec -- 10 to 16 words / 3 to 5 bars
1sec -- fun, upbeat

5 sec Rule

No more than 5sec to change what the audience sees.

Captions
Onscreen text
camera angles
B-rolls
Stock footage
Quick tidbits of info
short intense burts of attention

a scene = just enough time to absorb info then jump to next scene

MidJourney > Photoshop > Magnific > Kling

Deepseek to craft the script


Hailuo/Kling/KreaAi/PhotoAI/synthesia to generate the scenes

Runaway for post production

ElevenLabs for narration

Veed.io for captions

Okay, the user is asking about creating high-quality Hollywood-level movie clips in 9:16 format for social media, specifically for sci-fi and surrealism genres. They mentioned using MidJourney, Mystic, Magnific, and Kling. Let me break down the process step by step.

First, I need to consider the workflow. Starting with concept art makes sense. MidJourney is great for generating initial visuals, especially for surreal and sci-fi themes. But they might need to iterate a lot to get the right style and composition. Maybe suggesting specific prompts and aspect ratio settings in MidJourney would help.

Next, upscaling with Magnific AI could enhance the resolution and details. But wait, the user mentioned Mystic. I should check what Mystic does. Oh, right, Mystic Motion is for adding motion to still images. So the order would be MidJourney for images, then Mystic to animate them, then Magnific for upscaling. But wait, does upscaling happen before or after animation? If you upscale first, the animation might be smoother. Or maybe animate first, then upscale. I need to clarify that.

Then, Kling for lip-syncing if there's dialogue. But the user's scenario is for social media clips, so maybe they need voiceovers or text-to-speech. Including a step for audio is important. Also, editing tools like CapCut or Premiere Pro for final touches, adding effects, transitions, and ensuring the 9:16 format.

Budget is another consideration. MidJourney and Magnific have costs, so suggesting free alternatives where possible could be helpful. Maybe Runway ML as an alternative for some steps. Also, the importance of storyboarding and scriptwriting before jumping into asset creation. Even short clips need a narrative structure.

Testing on social media platforms to see what resonates is a good final step. Maybe they should create multiple variations and A/B test them. Also, mentioning the hardware requirements—high-quality renders and animations might need powerful GPUs.

Wait, did I miss any tools? The user listed MidJourney, Mystic, Magnific, Kling. Let me make sure the workflow includes all of them in the right order. MidJourney for images, Mystic to animate, Magnific to upscale, Kling for lip-sync if needed. Then editing software for assembly. Also, maybe suggesting DaVinci Resolve for color grading.

I should outline the steps clearly, maybe in a numbered list. Start with concept and storyboard, then image generation, animation, upscaling, audio, editing, and final export. Highlight each tool's role and alternatives. Mention the importance of each step and tips for maximizing quality, like using specific prompts and aspect ratios.

Also, note that Kling is for lip-syncing, so if the clip doesn't have dialogue, that step might be skipped. Maybe suggest using ElevenLabs for voiceovers if needed. And remind them about the 9:16 format throughout the process to ensure all assets are properly sized.

Finally, a pro tip about starting with shorter clips to manage costs and complexity. Social media audiences prefer shorter content, so 15-30 seconds might be better than longer clips. Emphasize iterative testing and community feedback to refine the clips.

Here's a professional workflow for creating Hollywood-quality sci-fi/surreal social media clips in 9:16 format:

**1. Concept Phase**
```text
1.1 Script & Storyboard (Essential for narrative coherence)
1.2 Style References (Collect 10-15 visual references for consistency)
```

**2. Asset Creation Workflow**
```language:workflow
MidJourney v6 (Initial concept art)
↓
Mystic Motion (Add dynamic camera movements/3D parallax)
↓
Magnific AI (4K upscale + detail enhancement)
↓
Kling AI (Character lip-sync if needed)
↓
Runway ML (Scene transitions/VFX polish)
↓
DaVinci Resolve (Color grading + final edit)
```

**3. Key Technical Considerations**
- **Aspect Ratio:** Always start prompts with `--ar 9:16 --style raw` in MidJourney
- **Motion Control:** Use Mystic's 3D camera projection for cinematic moves
- **Upscale Strategy:**
  1. MidJourney native upscale first
  2. Magnific at 2x with "Sci-Fi Film" preset
  3. Topaz Video AI for motion stabilization

**4. Audio Integration**
```language:production
- ElevenLabs (Voice cloning/narration)
- AIVA (Original score generation)
- Epidemic Sound (Professional SFX library)
```

**5. Post-Production**
- Add film grain (2-3% in Resolve)
- Use anamorphic light flares
- 24fps conversion for cinematic look
- Black bar letterboxing (even in 9:16)

**Budget-Friendly Alternatives**
- Leonardo.ai (For initial concept art)
- Pika Labs (Free alternative for motion)
- Shotcut (Open-source NLE)

**Pro Tip:** Create 15-30 second micro-scenes rather than long sequences. Social media algorithms prioritize completion rates, and Hollywood studios use this format for viral marketing. Always include 3 versions:
1. Textless copy
2. Vertical optimized (9:16)
3. Behind-the-scenes teaser

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific phase or provide template prompts for sci-fi/surreal aesthetics in MidJourney?
