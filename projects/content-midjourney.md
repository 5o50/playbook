> Short and simple prompts typically generate the best images with Midjourney
> phrases that clearly describe what you want to see
> giving a quick snapshot of your idea
> Avoid making long lists or detailed instructions; these can confuse the process

BAD: Show me a picture of lots of blooming California poppies, make them bright, vibrant orange, and draw them in an illustrated style with colored pencils

GOOD: Colored pencil illustration of bright orange California poppies

**Choose the Right Words**
The words you pick matter! Try using specific synonyms. For example, instead of "big," consider "huge," "gigantic," or "enormous." Being precise can help get better results.

**Be Specific with Numbers**
Plural words like "cats" can be vague. Instead, use specific numbers like "three cats." Or go for collective nouns like "flock of birds" instead of just "birds."

**Focus on What You Want**
Describe what you do want instead of what you don’t. If you mention a party with “no cake,” a cake might still appear. For excluding items, read about the no parameter.

**Prompt Length and Details**
Your prompts can be simple—even a single word or emoji works. Short prompts let Midjourney's default style fill in the gaps. But if specific elements are important to you, be sure to include them. Fewer details mean more variety, but you get less control over the outcome.

Be clear about details that matter to you. Here are some areas to consider:

- Subject: Who or what? (person, animal, character, location, object)
- Medium: In what form? (photo, painting, illustration, sculpture, doodle, tapestry)
- Environment: Where? (indoors, outdoors, on the moon, underwater, in the city)
- Lighting: What kind? (soft, ambient, overcast, neon, studio lights)
- Color: In what shades? (vibrant, muted, bright, monochromatic, colorful, black and white, pastel)
- Mood: Feelings to evoke? (playful, calm, gloomy, energetic)
- Composition: How is it framed? (portrait, headshot, closeup, birds-eye view)
