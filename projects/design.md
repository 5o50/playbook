**ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS FIRST**
Focusing on the needs of humans
Getting the process out of the hands of designers
Getting the active participation of the community
We can tackle bigger and more interesting questions

make the product iconic. add meaning â€” story to the product â€” devil is in the details.

Tell a great interactive story
Friendly, invinting  and functional


- As far as the customer is concerned, **the interface is the product.**
        The way that you accomplish tasks with a product â€” what you do and how it responds â€” that's the interface


Functionality can be improved by testing a variety of different sizes and placements of UI elements to allow users quicker and easier access. Designs with otherwise high functionality will likely be considered useless if people are unable to navigate and find what they are looking for. Consider the learning curve required to use the application and devise a way for each screen to provide a simple experience for beginners and â€˜power usersâ€™ alike.. Successful designers focus on functionality before form, and later bring both into balance.

DESIGN THE PRIMITIVES WELL AND COMPOSE WITH THAT !

The height of cultivation is simplicity. / The highest level of mastery is simplicity.

Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.

Simplicity is not the absence of clutter, that's a consequence of simplicity
Simplicity is somehow essentially describing the purpose and place of an object and product.
The absence of clutter is juste a clutter free product. That's not simple.

Law of contrast: Context informs perception.

Background color affect how colored objects are perceived.

Pure grey does not exist in nature, use subtle variations.
Color does not add a pleasant quality to design, it enhances it.

To match color your need to understand that color is context dependant
The most salient color will be the one with the most contrast with its surrouding.

> It's all about contrast and light. 
> Humans notice more the changes of contrasts than the colors themselves. / Human eye better at picking up Contrast than colors.
Always bring light to your face --> top should be lighter than bottom

Porter les couches fines et douces près du corps, les plus épaisses et brutes par-dessus
À peu près la même épaisseur entre elles, qu’on porte pendant la même saison
Toutes les textures de tissus ne renvoient pas la même image
Mats ou brillants, épais ou fins, votre allure ne sera pas la même
Tissus mats et fins rendent les rondeurs flatteuses et évoquent la douceur
Mats et épais renforceront l’autorité des femmes grandes et anguleuses, mais seront déconseillées pour les plus petites
Un tissu lisse et doux aura systématiquement une apparence plus luxueuse et évoquera la qualité
Quant aux tissus satinés, ils adoucissent la silhouette mais marquent davantage les rondeurs (et les imperfections) en en rendant évident chaque détail, surtout s’ils sont moulants
Motifs de la même catégorie. Mariez deux imprimés ethniques, deux imprimés fleuris, deux imprimés géométriques…Sinon, ça risque de ressembler à un défilé du carnaval
motifs de meme styles: campagne, ville, etc
motifs de avec suffisement de difference d'echelle pour créer du contraste
Couleur uni plus formel que motif et motif fin plus formel que motif grossier
Rayure verticale elances la silhoute et rayure horizontale elargisse les corps etroits
Plus l'imprimé est voyant plus la coupe doit être sobre

G: The open counter and tail can be uniquely shaped, making it a favorite for brands wanting a memorable mark.
K: The diagonal strokes allow for dynamic adjustments and custom ligatures.
M and N: Their symmetry and angularity can be played with for bold, geometric effects.
R: The leg and bowl provide room for distinctive curves or angles.
S: Its curves are visually dynamic and can be stylized for extra flair.
X and Z: Their strong diagonals stand out, especially in minimalist or geometric logotypes.

a: The double-storey 'a' in neo-humanist fonts is particularly expressive and can be customized for personality.
g: The two-storey 'g' (common in neo-humanist and some neo-grotesque fonts) is complex and visually unique, often used to add character.
e: The open counter and terminal can be adjusted for a friendly or modern look.
k: Its ascender and diagonal stroke allow for creative ligatures and connections.
r: The short arm and open bowl can be customized for a modern or approachable feel.

Distinctive shapes are memorable and allow for creative branding
- double-storey letters: 'g', 'a' help you see how the font handles complex shapes and counters
- diagonal 'k'

Curves, bowls, and negative space are areas where designers can add subtle or bold personality and reveal the quality of curves and negative space
- 'S', 'G', 'a', 'e', 'g', 'o', 'e', 'c', and 's'

Diagonal elements provide visual energy and can be stylized for uniqueness. Show how the font manages angles and intersections
- 'K', 'X', 'Z'', 'k', 'v', 'w', 'x', and 'z'

Ascenders/Descenders display vertical proportions and stroke endings
- 'b', 'd', 'f', 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'p', 'q', 'y', and 'g'

Crossbars and terminals show how horizontal elements are treated.
- 'A', 'e', 'f', 't', 'G', 'R' 

Many iconic logos leverage these interesting letterforms for instant recognition.
- Chanel with the interlocking 'C's
- Zara’s stylized 'A'
- Sony’s bold 'S'

Brands often choose all-caps or all-lowercase for impact, but the most memorable logos usually feature custom tweaks to these standout letters.

## Brand Identity
place yourself in the correct state of mind
the proper attitude is interested and aesthetically fascinated and sensitive.
produce something of worth, beauty and elegance
Do you plan to settle for ugly and uncouth?
Do you want to destroy, instead of build?
You must choose a topic that is important to you.
This should be formulated as a question that you want to answer.
arguably the hardest part of writing an essay: choosing the proper question
It’s a moral, spiritual endeavour. 
You have to determine how to write about one of those topics in a manner that is compelling to you. 
Properly identify something of interest to you = put yourself in alignment with the deeper levels of your psyche, your spirit. 
If these deeper levels do not want or need an answer to the question you have posed, you will not possibly be interested in it. 
So the fact of your interest is evidence of the importance of the topic.
You, or some part of you, needs the answer – and such needs can be deep enough so that life itself can depend upon them. 
Someone desperate, for example, might find the question “why live?” of extreme interest,  and absolutely require an answer that makes life’s suffering worth bearing. 
Do not waste your time with ideas that do not grip you.

- **brevity**: concise and efficient expression
- **beauty**: melodic or poetic aspect of your language
- **engaged**: not be bored, or boring
  If you are bored while writing, then, most importantly, you are doing it wrong, and you will also bore your reader.
  Think of it this way: you get bored for a reason, and sometimes for a good reason.
  You may be bored while writing your essay because you are actually lying to yourself in a very deep way about what you are doing and why you are doing it. Your mind, independent of your ego, cannot be hoodwinked into attending to something that you think is uninteresting or useless. It will automatically regard such a thing as unworthy of attention, and make you bored by it.
  If you are bored by your essay, you have either chosen the wrong topic (one which makes no difference to you and, in all likelihood, to anyone else) or you are approaching a good topic in a substandard manner. Perhaps you are resentful about having to write the essay, or afraid of its reception, or lazy, or ignorant, or unduly and arrogantly skeptical, or something of the kind.
- **finished beats perfect**


## Brand Draft (ideation)
Managing and marketing a premium brand demands that we think through every facet of the brand experience. 
strategic, structured way to present core ideas that shape a brand.
vessels that help us convey possible core ideas at the base of a brand's final brand identity
at the heart of most great brand identities is a core idea that acts like a common thread that can be found throughout every single brand expression

bolt: lightning bolt
cohere: intelligent building blocks
thread: threads

core idea: abstract layer that mirrors the brand's essence and personality
- theme
- hook
- metaphor
a common thread that pulls everything together

allow to piggyback off existing mental constructs to help translate your brand' s essence and personality into something tangible and familiar

this core idea is not much more than a hard-to-grasp mental construct on its own
thats why it requires a body to turn into something more tangible
into something that sticks => a brand concept. 
Brand concept: a collection of visual, verbal, and experiential elements that work together to express the brand's core experience.
It's defined in a Brand Draft.

**Strategy first** great branding is strategic by nature.
if you leave strategy out of the equation, you're just shooting off pure superficial aesthetic preferences.
=> you need a brand strategy to guide your brand identity.
And of course take a deep dive into a business’ audience and competition.

1. Agenda
2. Recap of brand positioning
3. Competitor audit
4. What we head specific to visuals
5. Things to keep in mind
   - Change can be a little bit uncomfortable. but this is where the growth happens!
   - Think of these directions as broad strokes.
   - Refining the details comes next.
   - The goal is to pick one direction to refine. Things like color and type can change but avoid the frankenstein.
   - All directions consider scalability and flexibility for your company.
   - Try to steer clear of the subjective. Everyone has personal preferences, but let's keep our eye on our target audience.
6. Brand direction name + description

7. Finding direction
   - Brand Boards
   - Mood Boards
8. Brainstorming / Sketching
   - Word mapping or Word Association Exercises
   - Pen + Paper Rough Sketches
   - Digital Symbols, Icons and Drawings
9.  Concept Refinement
   - Narrow down concepts
   - More attention to a small batch of concepts
   - Make small tweaks
10. Developing System
   - Fonts
   - Color choices or combinations
   - Icon
   - Brand language
11. Creating a Presentation + Deliverables
   - Create and send the final files to the client
   - Create a presentation for our portfolios

**Branding always happens**
Branding is a deliberate pairing of things through an outcome. / actively shaping a distinctive brand
If customers hate the pairings, business will make less money.
Pair with things that are important to customers, and business will make more money.

Pair your brand with hot topics, big desires.

Brand identity is the collection of all brand elements that the company creates to portray the right image of itself to the consumer.

Brand is the perception of the company in the eyes of the world.
refers to the perceived image and subsequent emotional response to a company, its products and services.
the conversation that customers are having with each other about the company, and how that spreads.
A brand is the set of expectations, memories, stories and relationships that, taken together, account for a consumer’s decision to choose one product or service over another. If the consumer (whether it’s a business, a buyer, a voter or a donor) doesn’t pay a premium, make a selection or spread the word, then no brand value exists for that consumer.

A BRAND SERVE FOR LOYALTY
- Branding is all about consistency -- consistency in the colors you use, the words you say and, most importantly, the experience users have with your product.
- Authenticity means; acting in a way that we expect you to act, being consistent, even when we’re not looking. And that’s when brands fall apart, when we discover that behind the scenes you’re not who we thought you were.
- But if we’re consistent in being who people think we are, then we’re seen as authentic. When we’re seen as authentic the promise of the brand becomes more valuable.”
- If your brand doesnt screa, "Im the result you want", you ve failed.
- You cant sell transformation if you dont embody it
- in business show success.
- in fitness show esults
- in coaching show power
- nobody buys from someone whos all talk and no proof
- Be the living example of what you sell -or stop expecting people to buy.

**The key to developing your brand symbols is to focus on function.**
mass market products mainly stand for their functionality
luxury products generate numerous non-functional, abstract associations
"every notion of functionality is reduced as far as possible."
there is no other product category with a similar relevance of symbolic benefits, which often even exceeds its functional benefits
"I have a very special relationship to cars. They have to turn me on. It’s very much about feelings, a lot of feelings. A [Mercedes] S-class can come with super features, but it just doesn’t turn me on."
these products "have a lot to say – they talk to you."
symbolic meaning = human values and lifestyles
symbolism of luxury products and brands = brand personality

five major dimensions of the luxury brand personality
- modernity
- prestige
- sensuality
- understatement
- eccentricity

Luxury products cannot symbolize anything
but just as with their aesthetics
need to comply with the worldview and taste of the upper class
"the DNA of luxury is the symbolic desire to belong to a superior class."

all luxury brands have to possess a high level of prestige, which they also have to symbolize at least to some extent

Symbolic meaning conveyd through :
- product design
- specific product information (famous movie star recommends the product)

Luxury products are often linked to :
- popular celebrities
- prestigious events
- attractive country-of-origin

"It is very fascinating to open a bottle of wine from 1912, which witnessed two World Wars – and when you imagine everything that has happened since that time..."

the symbolic meaning of luxury products is also highly influenced by their brands

Luxury brands create associations :
- high level of price
- quality
- aesthetics
- rarity
- extraordinariness
- high degree of symbolic meaning

can only be achieved by adequate marketing and especially communication measures. 

marketing-mix strategies influence consumer perceptions

Branding elements: what areas of your brand can you distill and express through a simple visual shorthand?
describes the visual devices used to represent the company

visual components package that is paired with style guidelines and used as a framework to ensure the corporate image is cohesive and consistent.

Some of the visual devices that leverage the brand elements and style guidelines are as follows: 
stationery: http://designspiration.net/tag/stationary/?utm_source=CMblog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=Designing+a+Brand+Identity
marketing collateral: http://designspiration.net/tag/marketing/?utm_source=CMblog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=Designing+a+Brand+Identity

Those tangible elements—the shoes, the haircut, the team membership—that’s brand identity. Your brand identity is what makes you instantly recognizable to your customers. Your audience will associate your brand identity with your product or service, and that identity is what forges the connection between you and your customers, builds customer loyalty, and determines how your customers will perceive your brand.

- **Name** https://www.zinzin.com/naming-branding-manifesto/#manifesto-22
- **Logo** is the central, identifiable visual element that helps customers discover, share and remember a company's brand. Usually it's in the form of an icon (mark or symbol), logotype, or combination of the two. Logos are crafted to present the company name in an attractive, functional way. Symbols, on the other hand, are mini-billboards. Their job is to connect the tribe and convey meaning. the logo is likely to reflect the core idea or hints at it, while fitting in with form decisions based on personality (think: ‘bold’ or ‘friendly’). By doing so we ensure the final brand identity is going to be as strong and cohesive as possible. 
- **Typography**
- **Colors**
- **Imagery and patterns**
Imagery can refer to photography, illustration work, artwork, iconography or a combination of those things. Adding imagery to the concept helps pull everything together and to show the versatility of the concept.
- **Symbol** to signal to consumers a certain level of quality, experience, and trust. Symbols can be a status symbol like Apple, Versace’s Medusa, and Ferrari’s prancing horse. 
A symbol represents what surrounds it : the Context
symbol: a thing that represents something else; usually something physical that represents something more abstract

Symbols, like artifacts, are things which act as triggers to remind people in the culture of its rules, beliefs, etc. They act as a shorthand way to keep people aligned.
Symbols can also be used to indicate status within a culture. This includes clothing, office decor and so on. Status symbols signal to others to help them use the correct behavior with others in the hierarchy. They also lock in the users of the symbols into prescribed behaviors that are appropriate for their status and position.
There may be many symbols around an organization, from pictures of products on the walls to the words and handshakes used in greeting cultural members from around the world.
Every culture is filled with symbols, or things that stand for something else and that often evoke various reactions and emotions.
Some symbols are actually types of nonverbal communication, while other symbols are in fact material objects.
Shared symbols make social interaction possible.
The secret here is to pick a symbol and attribute value to it over time.
Over time, they build in meaning and power for the people that are in the know.
As a leader, you need to identify your symbols and begin to layer them with meaning and values.

Nonverbal symbols
all societies have nonverbal symbols we call gestures, movements of the hands, arms, or other parts of the body that are meant to convey certain ideas or emotions
- shaking hands: friendship, sign of both greeting and departure
- nodding: yes
- thumbs up: great
- thumbs down: bad
- peace sign: peace
- middle finger: middle finger

Object Symbols
Some of our most important symbols are objects
- flag: freedom, democracy, and other American values and, accordingly, inspires pride and patriotism.
- cross: Christianity
- Star of David: Judaism
- crescent moon: Islam

Natural Symbols
- tree: growth, renewal, and other positive associations
- water: life, renewal, and other positive associations
- fire: passion, energy, and other positive associations
- earth: stability, grounding, and other positive associations
 
recognizable object that’s been altered to make it more unique and memorable.

Something free (not hiding and protecting)
Something magic (not boring)
Something beautiful

- **Tone of voice**
- **Tagline**
- **Stories** The brands you use, wear, and display all tell little stories. They help you express your personality and beliefs, and they help others identify with you.
- **Products** bottle so distinct that you would recognize if by feel in the dark or lying broken on the ground.
- **Attitudes** are the external displays of underlying beliefs that people use to signal to other people of their membership. This includes internal members (look: I'm conforming to the rules. Please don't exclude me). Can be used to give warning, such as when a street gang member eyes up a member of the public. By using a long hard stare, they are using national cultural symbolism to indicate their threat.

Coke challenged itself to create a bottle that was recognizable “by feel in the dark or lying broken on the ground.”

The company’s focus on function led to an iconic design.

Douglas Atkins states in the [Culting of Brands](http://amzn.to/1M5ukl8),

“There are also dangers in creating a symbolic system that is, well, symbolic of nothing. Aesthetics are not enough. Icons are only icons because they communicate a world of meaning to the community that honors them.”

Developing symbols for your brand are deliberate, and they take many forms. Symbols can be a navigational tool like the Twitter and Facebook icons. Symbols be a differentiator like the Coca-Cola bottle. Symbols can be a status symbol like Apple, Versace’s Medusa, and Ferrari’s prancing horse.

To create symbols for your brand start with a key customer touch point. Coca-Cola, for example, focused on its bottle because it was the direct point of contact between the consumer and product. What is the most visible or prominent customer touch point with your products and services? This a good starting point. Challenge your team to develop a visual shorthand that not only conveys meaning, but enhances the customer experience.

**The T-Shirt Test**

It’s often discussed that the epitome of branding is making your brand “tattoo worthy.” This is when you connect with your customers at such a deep, personal level they are willing to ink your brand on their skin.

I am not holding symbols up to the same standard. Instead make your symbols “t-shirt worthy.”

We live in a very branded society. You’re more likely to see a branded t-shirt than a blank one. Naomi Klein says, “Logos have grown so dominant that they have essentially transformed the clothing on which they appear into empty carriers for the brands they represent.”

I don’t consider this a bad thing. The logos we display on our clothing represent our values, beliefs, and connections. They signal which tribe you belong to.

Foursquare, the local search and discovery app, uses t-shirts to promote the brand. Users like [Baratunde Thurston](http://baratunde.com/blog/2010/10/26/today-im-rockin-my-new-foursquare-t-shirt.html) proudly wear “mayor” t-shirts. To an outsider this might not mean much, but to people who use the app it’s a symbol.

In Foursquare you become mayor of a location, like a restaurant or coffee shop, by checking in more than anyone else. When you achieve the mayor status Foursquare rewards you with a crown badge. And depending on the location, these crown badges can be highly coveted.

The mayor t-shirts extends the digital realm of the Foursquare app to the real world. This helps the brand grow awareness, engage its users, and build loyalty.

Creating a symbol that works on a t-shirt is easier said than done. Most logos look terrible on a t-shirt. Walk around any trade show and ask yourself, “Would I wear these logo’d golf shirts in public?”

For a symbol to work on a t-shirt it has to adhere to three qualities:

1. **Simple:** Simple images do better than complex ones. The Foursquare mayor symbol is identifiable as an icon or a large graphic on a t-shirt. The simplicity of the image allows it to be widely recognizable.
2. **Connective:** A symbol is more than a graphic. It has to be packed with meaning. Foursquare uses the mayor crown as a symbol, because that’s a badge people strive to acquire in the app. Use images that are packed with meaning and resonate with your tribe.
3. **Attractive:** This may be obvious, but it can’t be overstated. Iconic symbols like the Apple logo or the Coca-Cola bottle have a powerful aesthetic quality. They are well balanced, well designed, and something people are proud to wear. Iconic symbols are beautiful.

If you can create a symbol that works on a t-shirt, that’s a pretty good sign it will work almost everywhere. And if you do create a symbol that is t-shirt worthy, then by all means print a bunch of t-shirts to give away. Get your customers to wear your brand.

**Symbols Build Brand Equity**

Every iconic brand has symbols, because it enhances the economic value of the respective corporation.

David Aaker writes in [Managing Brand Equity](http://amzn.to/1hki30Q), “The reality is that most firms and products are fairly similar; the differences that do exist, such as service quality, are difficult to communicate in an effective and credible manner. When products and services are difficult to differentiate, a symbol can be the central element of brand equity, the key to differentiating characteristics of the brand. The symbol can by itself create awareness, associations, and a liking or feelings which in turn can affect loyalty and perceived quality.”

The symbol isn’t an artistic expression of the brand. It’s an emotive communication device that’s been used since the dawn of mankind. And it’s one of your most effective devices to stand out in a highly competitive, information rich marketplace.

A great product with a strong value proposition may not be enough. Consumers don’t truly believe there is a huge difference between products. That’s why we need to connect with them at a deeper level.

I’ll ask it again. How are you going to visually convey your value proposition and beliefs in a short, concise way?

WRITE YOUR STORY ON THE BACK OF YOUR BUSINESS CARD
tells a story. The brands that tell stories make a dent in culture. You know who they are. You have a sense of them. If they came to dinner, you would have a sense of their personality.
What is currently capturing the collective imagination?

Some big companies do perfectly well but they donâ€™t touch me. My head might understand it but my heart is not interested. Even if a startup works in a B2B setting, itâ€™s important to build a brand that people care about, that has emotion, that has human centricity to it. When youâ€™re meaningful in culture, you become sustainable in business.

In a nutshell, branding is who you areâ€”and marketing is how you build awareness. Branding is your strategy, while marketing encompasses your tactical goals. In order to determine who your brand is, you need to ask yourself several questions. Questions that go beyond industry generalizations, and services or products offered and also questions to determine who you are as a company, and more importantly, who you are as a brand. The questions below are an excellent place to begin:\n\n    What are your core principles and values?\n    What is your mission statement?\n    What inspired you to build your business?\n    Why do you want to offer your products or services to your target audience?\n    What makes you unique?\n    What is your internal company culture?\n    What is your professional sense of style?\n    What are your communication characteristics?\n    What do you want to come to mind when someone hears your business name?\n    How do you want people to feel when they think of your business?\n    How do you want customers to describe you as a company?

Think digital, act analog. Thinking digital means that companies should use all the digital tools at its disposal â€“ computers, web sites, instruments, whatever â€“ to create great products. But companies should act analog â€“ that is, they must remember that the purpose of innovation is not cool products and cool technologies but happy people. Happy people is a decidedly analog goal.

we are consistent and only repeat the same message over and over in everything we do


💡 **Advices**

**Pick a word from the dictionary**

If by the time you read through this list with a pen and pad in hand, you still don’t feel inspired, then you could do like Blizzard and Twitter did and just pick a random word from a dictionary.

**Remove or add an extra letter**

What if you have a really good name for your business, but can’t use it as it is? Why not do as Flickr and Tumblr do and drop the last vowel? You could also duplicate another letter or change a letter in your word in a way that still makes the word recognizable.

**Talk about what you believe in**

If you don’t like the story idea, you could use the name as a way to remind yourself – and anyone who works with you – about what you believe in and why you’re doing what you’re doing. Minolta, for example, means “your principle, what you believe in”.

**Tell your story**

Does your new business have a great story behind it? Why not tell it with your business name? Names such as Kenvelo (unable to decide on a name, the company was called Kenvelo, “yesandno” in Hebrew), Virgin (the founders' way of saying they were completely new to business) and Mozilla (created as the Mozaic – an internet browser-killer) were born the same way.

**Invent an alternative spelling**

Take a word that’s symbolic or essential for your company and invent a new spelling for it, like Reebok (alternate spelling of “rhebok”, an African antelope).

**Make a grammar mistake on purpose**

This way of coming up with a new name could be a bit risky, so do consider the possibility of spending the next five or ten years listening to people correcting your brand name. Quora, for example, could be seen as a fake plural of the latin quorum (public assembly).

**Abbreviate**

Take a word that has a strong meaning for you or your business and extract a short art of it, just like Cisco (from San Francisco, where the company was founded) did.

**Look at your product from another angle**

Does your product remind you of something else? Look at it from different angles or ask your friends and family to tell you what your product looks like. Blackberry and Caterpillar are just two examples of names created using this technique.

**Use Latin**

If you had a Latin language class in school and ever thought that you’d never get to use this in real life, you were probably wrong. Latin is a great source for business names, take for example Acer (Latin for “sharp”, “able”) and Volvo (Latin for “I roll”), two of the most well-known and easy to remember names. You could also use a Latin word as a start for your new name and add another word to it, like Verizon (from the Latin “veritas”, which means “truth” and “horizon”).

**Make it descriptive**

If you think of your business, what is the one word, or pair of words that could describe what the business does best? Now write all your options on a piece of paper and visualize your new logo or a banner with your new name on it. An example of a brand using this technique is the supermarket chain 7-Eleven, where the name tells you straight away what’s special about this business: it’s open from seven in the morning to eleven at the night, every day.

**Use a symbol**

Another way to come up with a business name is to take a symbol or an essential element of your work and create a new name starting from that word. Pixar, for example, is a combination of the word pixel and the initials of one of its founders, Alvy Ray Smith.

**Use nicknames**

Using your kids’ names or nicknames might sound a little strange, but just look at companies like Mercedes (named after the daughter of one of the founders) and Danone (named after the founder’s son’s childhood nickname); they don’t sound strange anymore, do they?

**Mix things up**

Another way of finding a new name for your business is trying various word combinations, such as your name and where you live. Some examples are DKNY (Donna Karan New York) and IKEA (from the founder’s name Ingvar Kamprad and where he grew up: Elmtaryd Agunnaryd).

**Take a look at a map**

Use a world map to get inspired, just like Adobe (after the Adobe Creek, running close to the founder’s house), Amazon (named after the largest river in the world, by volume of water) and Fuji (named after the highest mountain in Japan) did.

**Use your own name**

If you’re not convinced by any other names, why not use your own? Many of the most well-known brands were actually their inventor’s or their owner’s name, like Bayer (Friedrich Bayer was the founder of the company), Boeing (After William E. Boeing) and Grundig (named after the founder Max Grundig) and Cadillac (after the French explorer Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac).

**Use foreign words**

Even if your audience is based in one region, a foreign name (or foreign-sounding name) can be very memorable in your customers’ native language. Just look at Audi (the Latin translation of the German name “Horch”), Altavista (Spanish for “high view”) or Daewoo (“great house” in Korean).

**Get inspiration from mythology and literature**

Do you have a passion for literature or history? Look no further than your Greek and Roman legends! For example, ASUS (from the mythical winged horse Pegasus) and Nike (the goddess of Victory). A character, place or object could also be a good start for a name; like Samsonite (from the Bible character Samson) or Starbucks (from Starbuck, the young chief mate of the Pequod, in Moby Dick).

**Mash-ups**

Mix two or more words that are meaningful for you and your business. Some examples are Compaq (from “computer” and “pack”), Evernote (from “forever” and “note”), Groupon (from “group” and “coupon”) and Lego (from the Danish “leg godt”, which means to “play well”).

**evoke familiarity and connection**

**Unique — Yes, it has to be unique.**

There are tenable neurological reasons why your brand name should be unique. As long as it's not too wildly off-the-wall, a unique brand name can stick in people's minds like a burr on a hiking sock.

Yet the business reasons for a unique brand name are even more compelling. When a business enters the market place, it competes for a mindshare among the target audience. If it fails to catch their attention, it's doomed.

Furthermore, as brand signals increase in the digital marketing space, the brand's very existence depends on its unique identity.

You won't rise in ranking and be found by search engines if you choose a plain-vanilla word like "spark," or "hammer." You must differentiate yourself by creating an entirely new word or combination of words that doesn't break the cardinal rules of Simple, Short, and Memorable.

**Trendy(ish) — Don't follow outdated suggestions**

A brand name must have a trendy vibe if it's going to connect with trendy people. And yet, you don't want to veer too far in that direction.

Why not? Because a brand name that's trendy today might be completely outdated tomorrow. You want to have a name that will endure the next five years.

Outmoded advice for brand name creation includes identifying available domain names and choosing your brand name based on that. This just isn't as important as it once was, particularly due to the advances of SEO and [brand signals.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/neil-patel/how-to-analyze-your-brand_b_8230736.html)

You should still [pick your domain name strategically](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/239872), but don't weaken your brand name based on domain name availability.

**Simple — Make it easy to spell.**

Don't try to be cute by creating a brand name that is a misspelling of a common word. This will only confuse people and evoke bad memories of unpleasant spelling bees.

There is some wiggle room here. If your misspelling is so drastic that you essentially create a new word, that might be ok.

Hipmunk, for example, is a brand name that slaughters spelling, but violate expectation or conventional grammar. (See what I did there?)

**Short — It needs to be easy to remember (part 2).**

One of the [most-cited papers in psychology](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/) has this casual title: "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two."

The researchers claim that the brain can't juggle a lot of information at one time. Although the brain's ultimate capacity is virtually unlimited, it still faces challenges in storing, processing, and retaining select bits of information simultaneously.

Don't burden the brain with too much information. A brief brand name boosts memorability, fluidity of speech, and catchiness.

Uber, IBM, Buffer, Apple--brevity is a beauty.

**Descriptive — Make the name sell the brand's identity.**

Just as the brand name should have clarity, it should also be descriptive. The name should describe the business's industry, attitude, approach, and goals.

This doesn't mean that your brand name should list the product or service. Instead, it should capture the essence, the experience, and the benefits of the brand in an oblique or suggestive way.

Amazon, for example, chose a name that connotes massive growth and all-encompassing service. My brand, [Quicksprout](http://quicksprout.com/), suggests rapid growth.

**Clarity — Don't send mixed messages.**

The sound and feel of your brand name should suggest what the brand is all about.

For example, if your brand name is NomNom, this suggests food. NomNom should not be the name of a financial services SaaS. That would be confusing, and unencouraging.

To achieve clarity, assemble a list of the relevant buzzwords in your industry or niche. If you are creating a finance SaaS, you might have a list that includes "numbers," "spreadsheets," "accounting," or "books."

A hodgepodge of relevant words will trigger your brain to come up with a relevant name. Maybe this is how [Freshbooks](http://www.freshbooks.com/) came up with their name.

**Tap into the power of symbolism and sounds**

Certain sounds [inspire positive emotions](http://brandroot.com/resources/item/49-the-power-of-sound-symbolism-in-your-business-name) and result in experiences that are likely to be liked, remembered, and shared. Companies like Haagen Dasz and Limoncello have been leveraging this strategy for decades—to reinforce positive, memorable experiences through sound.

In a 2003, neuroscientist Vilanyanur Ramachandran [published a study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilayanur_S._Ramachandran) detailing the relationship between certain parts of the brain and metaphors. He concluded that sounds can be metaphors for images and that people experience sounds through colors and tastes.

When choosing your brand name, think about the words that you’re using in everyday life. At [Brandroot](http://www.brandroot.com/) you can pick out your new company name with ease. The founder, Michael Rader, points out you should focus on the words that you’re associating with specific sensory experiences: lightness, darkness, strength, weakness, sharpness, and dullness, as examples.

Think about the concepts that you learned in your high school English classes, including alliteration, assonance, interjections, and consonants. You can learn more and structure some of your ideas by [reading this article here](http://brandroot.com/resources/item/49-the-power-of-sound-symbolism-in-your-business-name).

**Appealing — The brand name should connect with your target audience.**

To say that a brand name should be "appealing" is pretty simple advice. Obviously, right?

Here's why I introduce it: a brand name should not merely be "appealing" overall (that's difficult to accomplish), but rather it should be appealing in particular to the brand's target audience.

Thus, to come up with the perfect brand name, you should first consider who it is you're trying to reach. What is their language? Their style? Their age? Their income? Their education? Their level of sophistication? Their interest? Their religious outlook? Their brand preference?

Take the brand VineMofo. This brand zeros in on the millennial, progressive, hipster population; they are not targeting baby boomer wine connoisseurs, not with a brand name like that.

I recommend not choosing a rudimentary, standard vocabulary word. Uber can be forgiven because it's not a common word. Apple can be forgiven, because they are, well, huge.

Make up your own word a la portmanteau.

Your brand name is a product itself. You have to sell it. It communicates the value, the purpose, and the identity of your business. When you can successfully connect the dots between your audience and your brand name, then you will achieve true appeal.

**Memorable — It needs to be easy to remember.**

The human brain is notoriously [bad at remembering names](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/08/why-do-we-forget-names-as-soon-as-we-meet-people/375815/). Why? The brain stores names in its short-term or working memory. In ordinary life, our working memory can be likened to our desktop. It keeps the information we are working on active and present for a time, but have too many windows open, and the system starts to crash.

The downside of working memory is that we can't keep track of everything at once, so, we forget things.

To be memorable, a brand name should counteract the brain's easy-in-easy-out tendency. How do you do this? By anchoring the brand name to another feeling, attitude, or sensation.

There are different types of memory. If your brand name can stimulate two types of memory--say, a physical [sensation](http://theweek.com/articles/460769/12-things-know-about-how-brain-works) and an emotional memory-- then the brain is more likely to remember it.

Here are some suggestions for creating a memorable brand name:

- Make it short (discussed below).
- Make it unique (discussed below).
- Use familiar words or sounds.

**Alliteration**

Alliteration is the repetition of the same sound at the beginning of two or more words in a sentence or phrase. This only needs to be a sound, not the same letter. Some examples are Best Buy, Krispy Kreme, Range Rover, Dunkin’ Donuts and Coca-Cola. Alliterations give your name a “beat” that can be catchy and memorable.

**Alliteration**

**Assonance**

Assonance happens when vowel sounds are repeated in words or phrases. Assonance can occur in a single word or a string of words (e.g. YouTube, Häagen-Dazs and FedEx), and it creates a pleasing sound.

**Consonance**

the recurrence of similar-sounding consonants in close proximity, especially in prosody.

**Imagery**

There has been [research](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/words-can-change-your-brain/201208/the-most-dangerous-word-in-the-world) published regarding how our brains connect words with emotions. This shows that people can experience sounds in the same way they experience color or taste. Some of the most cherished phrases in literature are those that evoke images in the reader's mind.

**Enduring — More than just your own name**

It would be nice if your brand were to outlive you. A brand can have a revolutionary effect on a generation. When that brand is inextricably tied to a single individual, it is less likely to do so.

With all due respect to Walt Disney, I suggest choosing a name that can endure alongside you, apart from you, and long after you are gone.

**Evocative**

**Remarkable**

**Contextual**

**Use memorization techniques to find concepts that stick**

The best company names are emotion-driven and memorable as a result. If you’re struggling to name your company, stop laser focus on what you want your company to be. Instead, think about the emotions that you want your target customer to feel.

Start by creating a mindmap of the concepts related to your [business](https://thenextweb.com/vocabulary/business/). Explore descriptive words, emotions, and experiences that you’ve felt in building your business or brand. From there, make an outline of the visual images associated with your company.

Consider going through the same mental exercises from when you were a child in school—playing memorization games through mnemonic devices to stretch your imagination further. This approach will help your mind venture into territory that you hadn’t yet considered. By exercising you mind, you’ll encounter new concepts and linguistic connections to build upon.

[As Rader points out](http://brandroot.com/resources/item/31-the-memory-game-using-memorization-techniques-to-choose-the-right-business-name), your goal in choosing a name for your business should be to find a concept that resonates with as many people as possible, rather than a select few customers. Create a visual image that your target audiences can easily recall. No matter what you decide or what relationships you find, always make sure to face-test your ideas.

**Become a lexical innovator**

If you can’t find a word that perfectly captures the essence of your brand, invent your own. Words are ever-changing and follow evolutionary cycles. There are new words, slang or formal, entering the market, all the time.

A readily apparent example of this trend is google—a word that arose from complete obscurity to eventually earn its place in the Oxford Dictionary. This was a company that walked away from what was common and known to test a completely new concept.

[Rader encourages](http://brandroot.com/resources/item/73-hip-trendy-business-names-are-you-bae-or-rekt) founders, brand managers, and other professionals responsible for naming to venture outside of their comfort zones. Explore slang that communities are using, and ask new audiences to describe your brand from a casual, authentic perspectives.

Innovation and progress come from venturing into new terrain. Your business name should be no different from your product or service—ask people to give words to your brand with a fresh pair of eyes.

If you need a word, invent it.

**Unique and Unforgettable**

In the trade, this is called "stickiness." But the issue of stickiness turns out to be kind of, well, sticky. Every company wants a name that stands out from the crowd, a catchy handle that will remain fresh and memorable over time. That's a challenge because naming trends change, often year by year, making timeless names hard to find (remember the dot.coms).

**Avoid Unusual Spellings**

When creating a name, stay with words that can easily be spelled by customers. Some startup founders try unusual word spellings to make their business stand out, but this can be trouble when customers "Google'" your business to find you, or try to refer you to others. Stay with traditional word spelling, and avoid those catchy words that you love to explain at cocktail parties.

**Easy to Pronounce and Remember**

Forget made-up words and nonsense phrases. Make your business name one that customers can pronounce and remember easily. Skip the acronyms, which mean nothing to most people. When choosing an identity for a company or a product, simple and straightforward are back in style, and cost less to brand.

Occasionally, business owners will choose names that are nonsense words. Quirky words (Yahoo, Google, Fogdog) or trademark-proof names concocted from scratch (Novartis, Aventis, Lycos) are a big risk. Always check the international implications. More than one company has been embarrassed by a new name that had negative and even obscene connotations in another language.

**Give a Clue**

Try to adopt a business name that provides some information about what your business does. Calling your landscaping business "Lawn and Order" is appropriate, but the same name would not do well for a handyman business. Your business name should match your business in order to remind customers what services you provide.

**Keep it simple**

The shorter in length, the better. Limit it to two syllables. Avoid using hyphens and other special characters. Since certain algorithms and directory listings work alphabetically, pick a name closer to A than Z. These days, it even helps if the name can easily be turned into a verb, like Google me.

Element of Design
Element of Composition https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_(visual_arts)

In Western art the Elements of Composition are generally considered to be:

- **Unity:** Do all the parts of the composition feel as if they belong together, or does something feel stuck on, awkwardly out of place?
- **[Balance](https://www.thoughtco.com/elements-of-composition-balance-2578092):** Balance is the sense that the painting "feels right" and not heavier on one side. Having a symmetrical arrangement adds a sense of calm, whereas an asymmetrical arrangement creates a more dynamic feeling. A painting that is not balanced creates a sense of unease.
- **[Movement:](https://www.thoughtco.com/elements-of-composition-movement-2578094)** There are many ways to give a sense of movement in a painting, such as the arrangement of objects, the position of figures, the flow of a river. You can use leading lines (a photography term applicable to painting) to direct the viewer's eye into and around the painting. Leading lines can be actual lines, such as the lines of a fence or railroad, or they can be implied lines, such as a row of trees or curve of stones or circles.
- **Rhythm:** In much the same way music does, a piece of art can have a rhythm or underlying beat that leads your eye to view the artwork at a certain pace. Look for the large underlying shapes (squares, triangles, etc.) and repeated color. (See example)
- **Focus** (or Emphasis): The viewer's eye ultimately wants to rest on the "most important" thing or [focal point](https://www.thoughtco.com/all-about-focal-points-in-painting-4092634) in the painting, otherwise the eye feels lost, wandering around in space.
- **[Contrast:](https://www.thoughtco.com/elements-of-composition-contrast-2578071)** Paintings with high contrast - strong differences between light and dark, for example - have a different feel than paintings with minimal contrast in light and dark, such as in Whistler series. In addition to light and dark, contrast can be differences in shape, color, size, texture, type of line, etc.

- **Pattern:** A regular repetition of lines, shapes, colors, or values in a composition.
- **Proportion:** How things fit together and relate to each other in terms of size and scale; whether big or small, nearby or distant.

The [Elements of Composition](https://www.thoughtco.com/elements-of-composition-balance-2578092) are not the same as the [Elements of Art](https://www.thoughtco.com/elements-of-painting-2577546), though composition is sometimes included as one of the latter.

**Shapes**
Imperfect geometric shapes tend to create tension and attract greater interest. But they may also look irregular or unfinished.

WHAT IS THE DESIGN BRIEF ? 
ex: "How do I take a train from London to New York ?"

when I see someone struggling with the product; he is not stupid; there is something to improve

Security at the expense of usability comes at the expense of security. if your â€œsecure systemâ€ isnâ€™t easy to use, people wonâ€™t use it, negating the security benefit.

> **Remove distractions to focus attention where it needs to be.**

describes one way to use the system, is centered around a goal (user profit)
+ written from the perspective of a user
+ uses the natural language of the business, and - on its own - does not tell the whole story.
+ User Stories contain, with user role, goal and acceptance criteria.
+ Use Cases contain equivalent elements: an actor, flow of events and post conditions respectively (a detailed Use Case template may contain many more other elements).
+ Define functions and think of features that support the functions

- holistically Consistent UNIFIED UX offers more functionality...all in a single, integrated app â€” as many features as possible into one application
                - FAST but not faster (respect user pace)
                - SIMPLE but not simpler (basic/dumb)
                - EFFICIENCY â€” reduce the screen time â€” we value user disengagement â€” not engagement
                - focus on small number of optimized valuable activities, strongly support things you value
                - digital minimalism â€”diminishing the large things, miss out on everything else.
                - assist the user intent; gets out of the way almost disappear; go with the way
                - minimal interface â€” rich social interactions.
                - **physical world first** - mobile-first - offline first: processing payments offline via QR codes at brick-and-mortar stores, live events, vending machines, restaurants, and hotels. The network effects are obvious and substantial: The more places that accept these payments, the more users will jump on board (and it goes both ways, both offline and online) â€¦ benefitting everyone all round.
                - **Natural design** â€” respect the human & environement â€” INTUITION, BALANCE & HARMONY
                - **Customizable**  â€” there is no avg user â€” every user is different.
                - **Clutter-free â€”** deceptively simple: let the user actively search for and discover all of these 3rd-party services themselves.
                - **Trusted** â€” **full ownership** â€” technology that you fully own. no spyware. no ads. no microphone. encryption â€” trusted by its usersâ€” is our foremost concern â€” so we can serve more sensible features like "Pay" or "Identity"
                - As media analyst Marshall McLuhan famously wrote, "**The medium is the message.**" In other words, "the form of a medium embeds itself in any message it would transmit or convey, creating a symbiotic relationship by which the medium influences how the message is perceived.
            - USER MUST FEEL
                - assistance, not dependence
                - valuable activities
                - being taken care of â€” educated
                - FLUID (ANIMATIONS ARE KEY.) streamlined interaction- liquid workflow
                - NO BIAS (woman/men/culture) design for kids unisex - simple white
                - evidence about the UI â€” able to adopt it quick â€” learn at his own pace â€” new things to discover
                - order / balance / harmony: bring order to the user mind â€” to sooth his anxiety
                - PLEASURE
                - PLAYFUL / FUN (GAME â€” WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW. MAKE A MINIMAL UI GAME â€” "TAP THE RECTANGLE" )
                - AT HOME
                - COMFORTABLE
                - IN CONTROL â€” if you can control, at least give the sense of control
                - TRUST - SECURITY
                - POWERFUL
                - VIVID
                - understatment has a chic denied to over emphasis
                - internal locus of control
            - **The right technology is a tool:**
                You can buy this device like you can buy a hammer. It's just a tool, isn't it what is all about technology ? A tool to help you.
                - a tool hides nothing
                - a tool adds nothing more than its function
                - a tool care only about the users and its environment.
                - a tool is accessible to any human being, no matter his age, color, religion


- **Product Design Strategy**
            as intuitive and straightforward as possible,
            We take on a habit of **understanding the essence (the question we answer) of each function and service** by **direct observation of user experimentation and cutting everything that goes against user interests.**
            > intuitive, carefully crafted, or just plain fun. We are busy focusing on small details.
            > Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it [a product] looks like. Itâ€™s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.

DESIGN IS HUMAN CENTERED
        (needs, useful, usable, enjoyable, what makes life easier )
        ITS MORE THAN SIMPLE ERGONOMICS (putting button in the right place)
        â€”> Understanding CULTURE and CONTEXT before starting having ideas

Good Designers understand how to use a material to its fullest extent.

Technology alone is not enough.
It's technology married with liberal arts, married with humanities, that yields us the results that make our heart sing.

> technology gets adopted because people use it and it's made for humans

Introduce the new with the familiar. when you introduce something new, donâ€™t do new on top of new because no one knows what youâ€™re talking about. Sometimes technologists get very excited about their own technology and they forget to build the stepping stones to bring people on.

Back in the early 1990s, a company called General Magic (today dubbed â€œthe greatest startup that you have never heard ofâ€) imagined what would be the first smartphone. The device would be able to grant immediate access to the internet and enable users to send emails (essentially text messages) to each other through a touch screen. As they shipped, the company quickly found out that the existing network infrastructure wasnâ€™t quite ready to support such a concept yet. The product did not sell and the company ended up failing. However, General Magicâ€™s commercial failure wasnâ€™t only due to the fact that they were way ahead of their time technologically. The market simply was not ready for such a product. Their Magic Link device was released back in 1994 when most people were still using pagers and certainly did not have email addresses. So, why would they want a clunky $800 device to send emails? Not only does this question bring us back to the necessity of relating your business to the human condition, but it also points out the importance of introducing new ideas and technologies with familiar concepts so they can be more readily accepted. General Magicâ€™s vision wouldnâ€™t be realized until 2007 with the launch of the first iPhone, which so many of us hold onto so dearly today.

[We should understand] that technology must never be accepted as part of the natural order of things, that every technologyâ€”from an IQ test to an automobile to a television to ac computerâ€”is a product of a particular economic and political context and carries with it a program, and agenda, and a philosophy that may or may not be life-enhancing and that therefore require scrutiny, criticism, and control.


If you think about it, culture and memory are the only things we have. We treasure cultural memory because we use that knowledge to build and produce everything we have around us. That knowledge is going to help us build the future and solve the problems we have yet to solve. If aliens come here and wave a magic wand and make everyone forget everythingâ€”our cars, buildings, bridges, airplanes, our power systems, and so forth, we would collapse as a society immediately.
