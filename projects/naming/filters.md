Okay, the user wants to know the smartest filter combinations to find brandable domain names using the Domain Name Pattern Filter. Let me start by understanding the tools they have. The pattern filter uses regular expressions with specific character groups like C for consonants, V for vowels, and others for repetitions.

First, brandable domains are usually short, pronounceable, and have a catchy structure. So I should focus on patterns that create such names. The examples given in the documentation mention CVCV (like Rare.com) which is a common structure. Maybe combining that with repetitions or specific letter placements could help.

The user might not know about the repetition characters. For instance, using A, B, H, K for letter repetitions could create memorable names. Also, number repetitions with D, E, F, G might be useful, especially for markets like China where numeric domains are popular.

I should consider mixing different character groups. For example, starting with a consonant, then a vowel, then a repeated consonant (CVC*C) could make names like "Puppy" or "Happy". Wait, but the pattern syntax needs to be precise. Maybe CVCV for four-letter names, or CVCCVC for longer ones that are still pronounceable.

Including the hyphen might help find available names, but hyphens can be less brandable. Maybe suggest avoiding them unless necessary. Also, using the starts with (^) modifier could help capture longer names that begin with a desirable pattern.

Combining the pattern filter with allow and block lists is important. For example, allowing only certain numbers or letters can refine results. If targeting Western markets, using the W (Western Premium) group might filter out less desirable letters.

I should list out effective patterns, explain why each works, and suggest combinations with other filters. Maybe prioritize short patterns first, then more complex ones. Also, remind the user to check TLD availability and trademark issues, which aren't covered by the filters but are crucial.

Wait, the user's guide mentions using allowlist and blocklist with up to 15 patterns. So suggesting multiple patterns separated by spaces in the allowlist would cast a wider net. For example, including both CVCV and VCVC to get different structures.

Number patterns like DEDE (repeating pairs) could be valuable. Mixing letters and numbers like CVCVNN might offer options, but brandability depends on the target audience. Maybe separate sections for letter-only, number-only, and mixed patterns.

Including examples for each pattern would help the user understand. Also, emphasizing the use of repetition characters to create memorable names, like ABAB for alternating letters.

I need to structure the answer clearly, starting with the most effective patterns, explaining their structure, and providing examples. Then mention how to combine with other filters like length, TLD, and character restrictions. Finally, add pro tips about checking availability and target audience considerations.

Here are some of the most effective pattern combinations for finding brandable domains, based on linguistic patterns and market trends:

```text
Top Brandable Pattern Combinations:

1. CVCV (4 letters) - Classic pronounceable pattern
   - Examples: Luma, Dovo, Zifi
   - Allow: CVCV | Block: CVVC (avoids awkward vowel combos)

2. CVCCVC (6 letters) - Memorable with consonant cluster
   - Examples: Brandl, Targen, Piltex
   - Add wanted chars: "BRLTN" for stronger sounds

3. VCVC (4 letters) - Vowel-starting alternatives
   - Examples: Aevo, Urtu, Onda
   - Combine with: ^VCVC (start with vowel)

4. CVC*C (4-5 letters) - Ending with repeated consonant
   - Examples: Puppy, Happy, Fizz
   - Use: CVCVC with blocklist "JQXZ" 

5. ABAB (4 letters) - Alternating repetition
   - Examples: Lolo, Cici, Bebe
   - Allow: ABAB | Block: AAAA

6. DEDE (4 numbers) - Repeating number pairs
   - Examples: 1818, 3434, 7979
   - Allow: DEDE | Block: "047" (unlucky numbers)

7. WVCWV (5 letters) - Western premium pattern
   - Examples: Pearl, Beast, Coast
   - Use W for premium letters + V vowels

CVCVC
A classic 5-character pattern that produces snappy, pronounceable names. Think of names that roll off the tongue with a simple consonant-vowel rhythm.

CVCVCV
Extends the search to 6-letter domains. The extra character might capture a little more diversity while still remaining easy to pronounce.

CooCCe
Leverages fixed vowels in key positions to mimic familiar “tech” name aesthetics (as in examples like Google or Foodle). This pattern injects a distinctive feel into your results.

MUMUM & VUMUM
These repetition-based patterns produce a rhythmic, memorable sound that many premium, brandable names tend to have. They help surface domains with a catchy cadence.
Try this master pattern out—and feel free to tweak or combine even more variants based on what breed of gem you’re hunting for. Enjoy your search!

Pro Tips:
1. Combine with length filter (4-6 characters)
2. Add TLD filter (.com .io .ai)
3. Use wanted chars for specific letters
4. Block hyphens unless needed
5. Mix 2-3 patterns in allowlist:
   "CVCV VCVC ABAB CVC*C"
   
Avoid:
- Unpronounceable consonant clusters (CCCV)
- Ambiguous letter/number combos (0 vs O)
- Overused patterns (LLLL numbers)
```

Remember to combine with:
1. Domain age filter (new registrations)
2. SEO potential filter
3. Trademark check (even if not in filter)
4. Social handle availability

The most valuable brandables often combine linguistic memorability with typing ease and emotional resonance. Consider your target audience's language preferences and cultural associations with letter/number combinations.
