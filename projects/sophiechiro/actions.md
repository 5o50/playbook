Regardless of what you hear, digital marketing is still the Wild West. 

For most cities in the US you can buy an exact match or partial match domain, build 30 or so links to it, and rank in 6 months. 

In many markets you can rent a $200 a month coworking spot in the middle of a city, list a business address there, name the business “City Business Service”(“Fresno Pest Control” for example). Text 50 friends over the course of time and get 50 reviews. You’ll start getting phone calls. 

With Reddit ranking as high as it is, you can create a number of burners to promote your business and buy upvotes for 10 cents a pop. Not only will you get eye balls from other Reddit users, you’ll also have a parasite SEO opportunity on your hands. 

The bar is seriously so low. Unless you’re something like a realtor in NYC, you can rank in Google. You can pop up in the map pack. You can get leads for your business.
