**Message Template:**
```
Hello! I'm looking for nose pore cleansing strips for the French market.

What I need:
- Nose strips/patches for beauty/cleansing (10+ pieces per pack)
- Good quality packaging for online sales
- Initial order: 1,000 units

Important requirements:
- Must be COSMETIC product (NOT medical device)

3. Can you show me photos of your products?
4. Can you add French text to packaging OR apply French stickers?

Looking forward to working together!
```

**Red Flags in Responses:**
- Mentions "medical device" classification
- Cannot provide ingredient lists
- Requests payment before samples/documentation
- No understanding of cosmetic vs medical difference

### Phase 2: Qualification & Education
**Goal**: Educate interested suppliers on requirements
**When to use**: After positive response to Phase 1

**Follow-up Questions:**
```
Great! A few more questions to ensure we can work together:

1. Classification: Can you confirm this is a COSMETIC product (HS Code 3304)?
2. Ingredients: Can you provide the complete ingredient list?
3. Compliance: Do you have CE cosmetic marking capability?
4. French Requirements: For France, I need:
   - All text in French on packaging (can be printed OR stickers)
   - Ingredient list in French (stickers acceptable initially)

**Week 4**: Phase 3 technical discussions with qualified suppliers
**Week 5-6**: Phase 4 samples and final selection
**Week 7+**: Production order placement

### üö® SUPPLIER EDUCATION TALKING POINTS

**When suppliers are confused about cosmetic vs medical:**
- "Nose strips for beauty/cleansing only - NOT for medical treatment"
- "HS Code 3304 (cosmetic) - NOT 9018 (medical device)"
- "CE cosmetic marking - NOT medical device CE marking"

**When suppliers resist French requirements:**
- "French law requires French language on all cosmetic products"
- "English-only packaging will be rejected by customs and TikTok Shop"
- "We can start with French stickers over English text - very easy solution!"
- "I can help translate text if needed"

**When suppliers seem overwhelmed:**
- "We can start simple and improve step by step"
- "I'll guide you through the requirements"
- "This opens the entire EU market for your products"

### üìã SUPPLIER SCORECARD

**Immediate Disqualifiers:**
- Insists on medical device classification
- Cannot provide any ingredient information
- Demands payment before documentation
- No willingness to accommodate French requirements

**Ideal Partner Indicators:**
- Understands cosmetic classification immediately
- Provides transparent ingredient lists
- Has EU export experience
- Professional packaging capabilities
- Responsive to compliance questions
- Willing to learn and adapt

**Compromise Acceptable:**
- Needs education on EU requirements (if willing to learn)
- Basic packaging that can be improved
- Limited French capability (French stickers are perfectly acceptable to start!)
- Slightly higher pricing for compliance (if reasonable)
- English packaging + French stickers (ideal quick-start solution)
