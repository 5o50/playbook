# Short-Form Video Editors

## Background & Analysis
The average attention span of internet users is around 8 seconds, so itâ€™s no wonder that the most popular videos are between about 20 and 35 seconds. 

That makes short-form video one of the most important marketing formats available today.

Surveys show that marketers plan to invest more in short-form video in 2024 than in any other marketing format. 

A portion of these investment dollars will go to short-form video editors. 

These tools enable creators to easily clip, edit, and optimize their content.

Many of these editors utilize AI. Some can add captions while others are able to scan the content and pick out short clips that are most likely to go viral.
