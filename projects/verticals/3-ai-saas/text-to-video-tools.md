# Text-to-Video Tools

## Background & Analysis
Video has become the preferred method of communication for most consumers—73% say they prefer to watch a short video when learning about a product or service. That’s compared to just 11% of consumers who prefer text-based communication like a blog post or website.

Video converts, too. More than 80% of shoppers say a video has convinced them to buy a product or service. 

Marketers echo this emphasis. More than 90% of marketers say they use video.

But cost is an issue. 

Brands pay an average of $2,000 for basic two-minute marketing videos. 

AI-powered text-to-video tools can drastically reduce the cost of video marketing.

Brands can use AI to create hundreds of hours of videos for less than $100 per month.

Text-to-video tools also remove another barrier to video creation: lack of time. With these AI tools, marketers can produce a video in under an hour.

75% of marketers have already started using AI tools to create and edit videos.

Industry predictions say the AI text-to-video market, which was valued at $163 million in 2024, could hit $1.4 billion by 2031.
